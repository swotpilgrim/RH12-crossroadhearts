# Chapter 15: Connection Deepens

The first time I call Nina from a pay phone, it's because I'm having a bad day and she's the only person I want to talk to.

I'm at a rest stop outside Des Moines, rain drumming on the truck's roof. The delivery I just made went wrong—late arrival, damaged cargo, the warehouse manager threatening to file a complaint. I'm tired and frustrated, and before I know it I'm at the pay phone feeding quarters into the slot.

I know the number by heart now. Called Betty's house enough times over the past months that my fingers dial it automatically.

Nina answers on the third ring. "Lawson residence."

"Hey. It's me."

"Ryan?" Her voice brightens immediately. "Is everything okay?"

"Yeah. No. I don't know. I just wanted to hear your voice."

"Bad day?"

"You could say that."

"Tell me about it."

Standing under the phone booth overhang, I tell her everything. She listens without judgment, just understands.

"You're still good at what you do," she says. "One bad day doesn't change that."

"I needed to hear you say it."

"I'll say it as many times as you need. You're good at this, Ryan."

We talk for another fifteen minutes until my quarters run out and the operator cuts in asking for more money. I don't have any more change, so we say goodbye and I hang up feeling lighter than I did before the call.

That's when I realize phone calls might be dangerous. Because if hearing Nina's voice can make a bad day better, I'm going to want to call her all the time.

And that's exactly what happens.

I start calling regularly. Tuesday and Friday evenings, when she's home from the diner. I plan routes around rest stops with working pay phones. Keep rolls of quarters in my glove box.

It becomes routine. Tuesday and Friday at eight, I'm at a pay phone feeding quarters into the slot until Nina picks up.

Sometimes we talk about important things—her day at the diner, her worries about Betty's health, my frustrations with Tommy or the road or the loneliness that creeps in during long drives. Sometimes we talk about nothing at all—the weather, what she made for dinner, a song that came on the radio. And sometimes we don't really talk, just breathe together across hundreds of miles of telephone wire, finding comfort in the connection even when there aren't words.

"I sit by the phone on Tuesday and Friday nights now," Nina admits during one call. "Grandma teases me about it. Says I'm like a teenager waiting for her boyfriend to call."

"You are a teenager waiting for her boyfriend to call."

"You know what I mean. It's just... these calls get me through the week. Knowing I'll hear your voice twice before I see you Thursday makes the two weeks feel less long."

"I know what you mean. These calls keep me sane."

And they do. The phone calls bridge the gap between our physical meetings, make the distance feel less impossible. When I'm driving through the middle of nowhere feeling like the only person on earth, I can remember Nina's voice on the phone the night before, the way she laughs at my stupid jokes, how she always asks if I'm eating enough and sleeping enough like she's worried about me.

Someone worrying about me. That's new. That's everything.

Tommy notices the phone bills.

"Ryan," he says one afternoon in his Omaha office, "you've racked up forty dollars in long-distance calls this month alone. Company phone is for business, not personal."

"I'll pay for them. Sorry, I should've asked first."

Tommy waves this off. "I don't care about the money. I care about you." He leans back in his chair, gives me that look he's perfected—half concerned boss, half surrogate father figure. "You're calling that girl in Junction City, aren't you?"

"Yes, sir."

"Twice a week, from the looks of it."

"Tuesday and Friday evenings. I'll start using my own money."

"That's not the point." Tommy sighs. "Kid, I've seen this before. Drivers who fall for someone in a specific town, try to maintain long-distance relationships with phone calls and brief visits. It doesn't work. Someone always gets hurt."

"Maybe it'll be different."

"Maybe. Or maybe you're setting yourself up for heartbreak by loving someone you can't really be with."

"I'm figuring it out."

"Well, figure it out faster. Because this limbo you're in—half on the road, half committed to Junction City—it's not sustainable. Eventually you'll have to choose."

I know he's right. But knowing and doing are different things, and I'm not ready to choose yet. Not until I know what I'm choosing between, not until I've figured out how to make staying possible.

I start paying for my own phone calls. It's worth every quarter to hear Nina's voice, to feel connected to her even when I'm hundreds of miles away. Other truckers notice me at pay phones during stops, probably think I'm calling my mother or a buddy. Nobody asks, which is fine by me.

Dale catches me at a rest stop in Iowa, shakes his head when I hang up.

"Still calling that Junction City girl?"

"Yeah."

"You're a fool. Long-distance longing leads nowhere good."

"Maybe I like where it's leading."

"Wait until she finds someone local who can actually be there for her."

"Dale. I appreciate the concern. But I'm working on being there. I'll figure it out."

He shrugs. "Your funeral. Don't say I didn't warn you."

He walks back to his truck, leaving me standing by the pay phone with Nina's voice still echoing in my head from our call five minutes ago. She'd told me about a customer at the diner who left a fifty-cent tip on a two-dollar meal, told me Betty's doctor said her heart medication is working better, told me she loves me and can't wait for Thursday.

That's not nothing. That's everything.

The following Tuesday, Nina and I are on the phone and there's a long comfortable silence. I can hear her breathing, hear the tick of Betty's grandfather clock in the background, hear the normalcy of her life continuing while mine stays perpetually in motion.

"I miss you," she says quietly.

"I miss you too."

"Not just Thursday-to-Thursday miss you. I miss you right now. I miss you all the time. Two weeks between visits and two phone calls a week isn't enough."

"I know."

"What are we going to do about it?"

It's the question I've been avoiding, the one that doesn't have an easy answer. What are we going to do? Keep going like this until one of us breaks? Until the distance becomes too much? Until we're both so tired of saying goodbye that we stop saying hello?

"I'm working on it," I say. "Talking to Tommy about options. Thinking about getting an apartment somewhere between Junction City and Kansas City, maybe taking that regional route he mentioned. I don't have all the answers yet, Nina. But I'm trying."

"I know you are. I just... I wish I could help. Wish there was something I could do besides wait."

"You're not just waiting. You're here. You answer the phone on Tuesdays and Fridays. You meet me for lunch on Thursdays. You love me even though I'm terrible at this. That's more than just waiting."

"I do love you."

"I love you too."

It's easier to say over the phone somehow, separated by distance and telephone wires. In person the words feel weightier, more dangerous. But on the phone they're just truth, simple and uncomplicated.

We talk until I run out of quarters and the operator asks for more money I don't have. We say goodnight reluctantly, both of us wishing for more time, and I hang up and stand in the Iowa darkness trying to remember when phone calls became essential instead of optional.

Every two weeks in Junction City isn't enough anymore. Tuesday and Friday phone calls aren't enough. I need more of Nina—more time, more conversation, more life shared instead of life reported after the fact.

I need to figure out how to stay.

Sitting in my truck that night, unable to sleep, I finally admit what I've been avoiding for months: I can't keep doing this. Can't keep choosing the road when what I want is Junction City. Can't keep leaving Nina when all I want is to stay.

Tommy's right—this limbo isn't sustainable. Eventually I have to choose.

And I'm starting to realize I've already chosen. I chose Nina months ago, when I kept coming back to Junction City instead of requesting different routes. When I started timing my arrivals to her lunch breaks. When I bought her ice cream and fixed Betty's porch and kissed her in that parking lot under October stars.

I chose her. Now I just need to figure out how to make that choice permanent.

The phone calls help, bridge the distance, keep us connected. But they're not enough. Nothing short of being there—really there, consistently there—will be enough.

Time to stop planning and start doing.

Time to talk to Tommy about that regional route for real.

Time to look for an apartment in Kansas City or Junction City or somewhere in between.

Time to stop being a trucker who's falling in love and start being a man who's building a life.

The highway stretches dark outside my windshield, but I'm not looking at the road ahead anymore. I'm looking past it, toward Junction City, toward Nina, toward a future that finally feels possible instead of impossible.

Two days until Thursday.

Two days until I can tell Nina in person what I've decided.

Two days until I start figuring out how to choose staying over leaving, how to choose her over everything else.

The phone calls are enough for now. But soon—soon I'll be there in person, not just a voice on the line but a presence in her life, a man who stays instead of always leaving.

Soon.

I just have to be brave enough to make it happen.
