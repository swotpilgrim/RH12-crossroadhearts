# Chapter 13: Building Something

Five months.

That's how long it's been since I helped Nina with her broken-down Chevy. Twenty biweekly stops, twenty Thursday afternoons, countless conversations that somehow never feel long enough.

We're building something, Nina and I. Building it slowly, piece by piece, across the distance that keeps trying to pull us apart. Building it despite the impossible logistics, despite the fact that I'm still living out of a truck and she's still stuck in Junction City caring for her grandmother.

Building it anyway, because neither of us knows how to stop.

October brings cooler weather and leaves changing color on the few trees that line Junction City's streets. I show up on a Thursday wearing a jacket, and Nina's wearing a sweater, and we smile at how we're both adjusting to seasons together even though we only see each other twice a month.

"Tell me something," Nina says over lunch—pot roast for me, grilled cheese for her. "Something you haven't told me before."

"Like what?"

"Anything. A memory. A favorite thing. Something that makes you you."

I think about this. "When I was a kid, my dad and I used to work on cars together in our garage. He taught me everything—how to change oil, replace brake pads, diagnose problems by sound. It was our thing, you know? Just us, grease under our fingernails, talk radio playing in the background."

"You miss it."

"I miss him." It's the most I've said about Dad to anyone since he died. "He made things make sense. When he was gone, everything fell apart."

Nina reaches across the table, takes my hand. "I'm glad you told me."

"What about you? Tell me something."

She thinks, playing with her straw. "When I was seven, Grandma Betty taught me to bake. We'd spend Saturday afternoons making pies—apple, cherry, whatever fruit was in season. I burned everything for the first month, but she never got mad. Just showed me again, patient as could be." Nina smiles at the memory. "She still asks me to make pie for her. Says mine are better than hers now, which is a lie, but a sweet one."

"Maybe you'll make me a pie sometime."

"Maybe I will."

These are the conversations we have now—deeper than they used to be, more personal. Building trust brick by brick, sharing pieces of ourselves we don't give to other people. It should scare me, this gradual opening up, but it feels natural with Nina. Safe.

I bring her things from the road. Small things, mostly—a postcard from Colorado showing the mountains I drove through, a smooth stone from a Wyoming riverbed where I stopped for lunch, wildflowers picked from a rest area in Nebraska. Tokens that say "I was thinking of you" without having to use words.

Nina takes each gift like it's precious. "You don't have to bring me things, you know."

"I want to."

"Well. Thank you." She tucks the latest postcard—this one from Kansas City—into her purse. "I keep them all. In a shoebox under my bed. Is that weird?"

"No. It's..." I search for the word. "Sweet."

She blushes and changes the subject, but I file that information away. She keeps everything I give her. She's sentimental about this, about us, same as I am.

The following week, Nina's parents call during our lunch. She excuses herself to take it at the pay phone, and I watch through the diner window as her expression shifts from happy to frustrated to resigned. When she comes back, she's quiet.

"Everything okay?"

"My parents want to know when I'm moving to California." She stirs her Coke absently. "They ask every time we talk. 'How's Grandma doing, when are you coming out here, we miss you.' Like I can just leave her."

"What do you tell them?"

"'Maybe next year.' Same thing I've said for the past twelve months." She looks up at me. "It's a lie. I'm not going. Not while Grandma needs me. But they don't want to hear that."

"They want you to be happy."

"They want me to have the life they think I should have. College, career, California sunshine. They don't understand that I'm..." She trails off.

"That you're what?"

"Content. Here. With Grandma. With..." She doesn't finish, but I hear it anyway. With you.

I don't know what to say to that, so I just squeeze her hand and we sit in silence that's become comfortable over months of practice.

Later that evening—I'm extending my stays more often now, finding excuses to linger instead of hitting the road—we're sitting on Betty's porch while Nina helps her grandmother shell peas. Betty's hands shake slightly with age, but she's insistent on doing it herself.

"Nina," Betty says without looking up from her work, "when are you going to admit you're in love with this boy?"

Nina nearly drops her bowl. "Grandma!"

"What? I'm old, not blind. I see how you look at him. How you light up when it's Thursday. How you talk about him all week like you're keeping count of the days."

"We're just—"

"Dating, I know. But you're in love with him. Might as well say it out loud."

Nina looks at me, mortified, and I'm probably blushing too. But Betty just keeps shelling peas like she didn't just drop a bomb into the conversation.

"Grandma Betty," I say, because someone needs to rescue Nina from this, "maybe that's something Nina and I should figure out ourselves."

"Hmm. Fair enough." But she's smiling. "Just don't take too long. At my age, I'd like to see my granddaughter settled and happy before I go."

"You're not going anywhere," Nina protests.

"We're all going somewhere, sweetheart. I just want to know you'll be all right when I do."

The conversation moves on, but Betty's words stick with me. Love. In love. Is that what this is? I care about Nina more than I've cared about anyone in years. I rearrange my whole life around seeing her. I think about her constantly, miss her when I'm gone, can't wait to get back to Junction City every two weeks.

That sounds like love.

But saying it out loud makes it real, makes it something we have to deal with instead of dancing around. And dealing with it means confronting the impossibility of our situation—that I'm always leaving and she's always staying, and neither of us has figured out how to change that yet.

When I leave that night, Nina walks me to my truck like always. We stand in the parking lot under October stars, reluctant to say goodbye.

"What Betty said..." Nina starts.

"You don't have to—"

"I think she's right." Nina looks up at me, brave and scared at the same time. "I think I'm in love with you. I don't know when it happened exactly. Maybe that first day when you fixed my car. Maybe when you bought me ice cream. Maybe every Thursday for the past five months, all at once."

My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it. "Nina—"

"You don't have to say it back. I know this is complicated. I know you're on the road and I'm stuck here and we haven't figured anything out yet. But I wanted you to know. Because I'm tired of pretending this is just casual. It's not. Not for me."

I pull her into a hug, her head against my chest, and feel her arms wrap around me. "It's not casual for me either. You're the most important thing in my life. The only thing that makes sense anymore."

"But you're not ready to say you love me."

"I'm not ready to say a lot of things. But that doesn't make them less true."

We hold each other in the parking lot while trucks rumble past on Highway 40, both of us knowing that this conversation changes things without knowing exactly how. When Nina finally steps back, there are tears on her cheeks.

"Two weeks?" she asks.

"Two weeks."

I drive away from Junction City with a weight in my chest that feels like hope and fear mixed together. Nina loves me. I'm pretty sure I love her too, even if I haven't found the courage to say it yet. And that means something has to change, because you can't love someone from a distance forever. Something has to give.

I just don't know what yet.

The miles roll by and I replay the conversation over and over. Nina standing in the parking lot telling me she loves me. My non-answer that was really an answer. The way she looked both relieved and sad when I drove away.

Five months of building something together, and now we've reached a point where building isn't enough anymore. We need a foundation. We need permanence. We need a plan for how this works beyond Thursday afternoons and phone calls and gifts from the road.

We need me to stay or her to leave or some third option I haven't thought of yet.

The truth is, I want to stay. Want to find a way to make Junction City home, to see Nina every day instead of twice a month, to be the kind of man who's there when she needs him instead of always leaving.

But wanting and doing are different things. And I don't know yet how to bridge that gap.

Two weeks until I'm back in Junction City. Two weeks to figure out what I'm going to do about being in love with a girl I can't seem to keep leaving, even though it hurts more every time.

Two weeks to decide if I'm brave enough to change everything for a chance at building something that lasts.

The highway stretches ahead, familiar and endless and suddenly not nearly enough anymore.

Time to figure out what comes next.
