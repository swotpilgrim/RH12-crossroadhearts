# Chapter 21: Rerouting

I requested the route change before leaving Kansas.

Pulled into a truck stop outside Salina, used the pay phone. Late afternoon, sky going dark, hands shaking as I dropped quarters in.

"Tommy's Freight."

"Ryan Cross. I need Tommy."

"He's in a meeting—"

"Pull him out."

Pause, then hold music. I leaned against the booth, watching trucks pass, trying not to think about Nina. About walking away. About leaving half my chest in Junction City.

"Ryan?" Tommy's voice came through the line. "What's going on? Everything okay?"

"I need a route change," I said. No preamble, no explanation. "The Kansas City-Tulsa run. The one that bypasses Junction City completely."

Silence. Then: "You want to tell me why?"

"No."

More silence. Tommy putting pieces together.

"This about the girl?"

Throat tight. "Yeah."

"What happened?"

"Didn't work out." Three words that didn't cover the wreckage. "I can't go through Junction City anymore."

"Okay." No questions. "Kansas City-Tulsa's yours. Starts Monday."

"Thanks."

"Ryan. You doing okay?"

Was I? I'd just cut Nina out completely. Should've felt free.

Instead I felt hollow.

"I'm fine," I lied.

"Sure you are. Be safe out there."

He hung up. I tried to convince myself I'd done the right thing.

Nina wanted a clean break. This was what she'd asked for.

Respecting her wishes. Being unselfish.

Except it felt like cowardice.

I drove. Kansas City, then Tulsa. No Highway 40. No Junction City. No Nina.

Clean break. Fresh start.

The run took me through different towns—small places that looked like Junction City but weren't, diners where waitresses who looked like Nina but weren't brought me coffee I didn't want. I kept my head down, drove my routes, ate alone, slept in the truck cab, and pretended I was fine.

Days blurred together. One week became two, then three. December came in cold and mean, snow starting to fall across Kansas and Oklahoma. I drove through it, windshield wipers beating steady rhythm, and tried not to count how long it had been since I'd seen Nina.

Twenty-one days. Three weeks. A lifetime.

Other truckers noticed the change. Dale Cooper stopped me at a rest stop outside Tulsa, gave me a long look over bad coffee.

"You look like hell, kid."

"Thanks, Dale. Really helpful."

"I'm serious." Dale sat down across from me uninvited. "What happened? You used to be mr. easy-going. Now you look like somebody died."

Close enough. Something had died—whatever hope I'd had that I could be more than a drifter, that I could build something real with someone who mattered.

"Just tired," I said.

"Bull." Dale stirred sugar into his coffee. "This about that Junction City girl?"

I looked up sharply. "How do you—"

"I'm old, not blind." Dale shrugged. "Saw you at that truck stop a few times. Saw the way you looked at her. Figured you'd fallen hard."

"Doesn't matter now."

"Why not?"

"Because it didn't work out. Logistics didn't work. She's stuck in Junction City, I'm on the road. End of story."

Dale was quiet for a minute. Then he said, "You know what my biggest regret is?"

I didn't answer, but he told me anyway.

"Thirty years ago I met a woman in Amarillo. School teacher, prettiest thing I'd ever seen. We dated for six months while I was running the Texas routes. She wanted me to settle down, get a local job, marry her. I told her I couldn't give up the road." Dale stared into his coffee like it might show him the past. "Thought I was choosing freedom. Thought the road was who I was. You know what I got instead?"

"What?"

"Thirty years alone. No wife, no kids, nobody waiting for me anywhere. Just truck stops and bad coffee and wondering what my life would've looked like if I'd been brave enough to stay." He looked at me hard. "Don't make my mistakes, kid. The road's a good escape, but it's a lousy life."

He stood up, left money on the table, walked out.

I sat there alone and hated how much his words hit home.

Because that's what I was doing, wasn't it? Choosing the road over Nina. Choosing safety over risk. Choosing the same pattern I'd been running for two years—motion instead of stillness, escape instead of commitment, loneliness instead of the terrifying vulnerability of letting someone matter.

I was becoming Dale. And Dale was miserable.

But what was I supposed to do? Nina had ended it. She'd looked me in the eye and said she couldn't do it anymore, that the goodbye was killing her. Going back to Junction City now would be selfish—forcing myself into her life when she'd explicitly asked me to stay away.

I finished my coffee and got back on the road.

The Kansas City-Tulsa run was uncomplicated. Same route every time, same stops, same truck stop in Tulsa where I parked overnight. No surprises, no complications, no risk.

No Nina.

The highway stretched out ahead of me, endless and empty. December wind hit the truck in gusts, trying to push me off the road. I kept my hands tight on the wheel and drove.

Somewhere in the back of my mind, I kept replaying that last conversation. Nina's voice cracking when she said _I'm in love with you_. The way she'd looked at me like her heart was breaking. The coffee going cold on the table between us while we tried to figure out how to say goodbye.

I should've fought harder. Should've told her I'd find a way to make it work. Should've asked Tommy about that regional route right then, should've promised Nina I'd stay, should've done _something_ besides just accept defeat and walk away.

But I hadn't. Because fighting for her would've meant admitting I wanted to stay, and admitting I wanted to stay meant confronting every fear I'd been running from since my father died.

Easier to just leave. Safer to protect myself through distance.

Except it didn't feel safe. It felt like dying.

I pulled into a truck stop outside Wichita, parked the Peterbilt, sat in the cab staring at nothing. The lot was mostly empty—couple of other trucks, some cars, the diner lights bright against the December darkness.

This was my life now. This was what I'd chosen.

Empty truck stops. Cold coffee. Endless highway. No Nina.

I lit a cigarette, hands shaking, and admitted what I'd been trying not to think about for three weeks.

I'd made a mistake.

Nina was right that the logistics were impossible. Right that we couldn't keep doing the two-week cycle. Right that something had to change.

But the change didn't have to be walking away. It could've been me choosing to stay. Me figuring out how to build a life in Junction City. Me being brave enough to want something more than the safe, uncomplicated existence I'd been hiding in.

I'd let fear win. Again.

And now Nina was in Junction City probably trying to move on, and I was on a different route wondering if I'd just made the biggest mistake of my life.

The cigarette burned down to nothing. I stubbed it out, sat in the darkness, and knew something had to give.

I couldn't keep doing this—couldn't keep running from anything that felt like commitment, couldn't keep choosing safety over the risk of being happy. Dale's words kept echoing: _Thirty years alone. Don't make my mistakes, kid._

I didn't want to be Dale in thirty years. Didn't want to be alone and full of regrets, wondering what my life would've looked like if I'd been brave enough to stay.

But going back to Junction City meant more than just showing up. It meant having a plan. It meant actually being able to offer Nina something real instead of just more empty promises and complicated logistics.

It meant changing everything.

I pulled out my wallet, found the business card Tommy'd given me months ago. Regional Routes Manager, Kansas City office. The number I was supposed to call if I ever wanted off long-haul.

I'd been carrying it for six months. Never called.

Maybe it was time.

The thought scared me more than anything had in two years. Giving up long-haul meant giving up the safety of constant motion. Meant settling down, building roots, becoming the kind of man who had an address and a routine and people who depended on him.

Meant risking everything I'd been protecting myself from.

But losing Nina—really losing her, permanently—scared me worse.

I sat in that truck cab and made a decision.

I was done running. Done choosing fear over hope. Done letting the past dictate my future.

If I was going to do this—if I was going to fight for Nina, for us, for a life that wasn't just endless highway—I needed to do it right. Needed a real plan, a real offer, a real reason for her to believe I could be what she needed.

I needed to be brave enough to stay.

The question was whether three weeks was too long. Whether Nina had already started moving on, protecting her heart the way I'd protected mine. Whether I'd burned the bridge too completely to rebuild it.

Only one way to find out.

But first, I had to make some changes. Had to turn this truck around—not literally, but in every way that mattered.

I started the engine, pulled out of the Wichita truck stop, and pointed the Peterbilt toward Kansas City.

Time to have a conversation with Tommy. Time to figure out what staying looked like.

Time to stop running and start fighting for what I wanted.

Even if it scared the hell out of me.

Even if I didn't know if it would work.

Even if Nina said no.

At least I'd know I tried. At least I wouldn't end up like Dale, full of regrets and what-ifs.

The highway stretched ahead, same as always. But this time, for the first time in two years, it felt like I was driving toward something instead of away.

Toward Nina. Toward home. Toward the terrifying, beautiful possibility of actually being brave.

I just hoped I wasn't too late.
