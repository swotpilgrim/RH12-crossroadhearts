# Chapter 24: Half-Life

I drove to Junction City at dawn.

Couldn't sleep, so I left at five. Highway empty, sky going from black to gray.

I reached Junction City as the sun came up, gold light across the plains. The Crossroads sat at 40 and 77, neon dim, a few rigs parked.

My heart pounded.

I parked near the diner, trying to breathe. This was it.

I got out, December cold biting through my jacket.

The diner was warm, smelling of coffee and bacon. Light breakfast crowd, Judy behind the register.

She looked up. Eyes went wide.

"Ryan?"

"Hey, Judy."

"What—" She looked toward our booth. Empty. "Nina's not here."

Stomach dropping. "Is she okay?"

"Fine. Just cut her hours to lunch shifts because of Betty." Judy's expression mixed sympathy and judgment. "You planning to fix this or make it worse?"

"Fix it."

"You better." Fierce. "If you're going to hurt her again, walk away now."

"I'm not." I pulled out Mike Harrison's card. "Got off long-haul. Regional position, Kansas City based. I'll be here every few days. Found an apartment. I'm staying."

Judy took the card, studied it, looked at me. Softened.

"You mean that."

"Yeah."

"Maple Street. White Victorian, green shutters."

"I know it."

"Then go. But don't screw this up."

I nodded, left the diner, got back in the car.

Main Street was waking up—stores opening, early shoppers. I slowed when I saw the flower shop.

The owner was just unlocking the door. Old guy, apron, surprised look.

I pulled over, got out.

"Morning."

"You open?"

"Just now. Come in."

The shop smelled like roses and something green. Buckets of flowers lined the walls.

"What can I get you?" the owner asked.

"Bouquet. Something nice."

He studied me. "For courting or apologizing?"

"Both, maybe."

He smiled. "I got just the thing."

He put together a mix—roses, some white flowers, greenery. Wrapped them in paper, handed them over.

"Good luck, son."

"Thanks."

I paid, walked back to the car with flowers in hand. Felt like an idiot. Felt like maybe I was doing something right.

Maple Street took three minutes from Main. The Victorian looked the same—white paint, green shutters, bare maples, smoke from the chimney.

Nina was inside. Making breakfast for Betty. Alone for four weeks while I'd been gone.

I sat in the car, finding courage. The bouquet sat on the passenger seat, wrapped in paper.

You drove four hundred miles for this. Made real changes. Don't chicken out now.

I grabbed the flowers, got out, walked up the steps, knocked.

Footsteps inside. The door opened.

And there was Nina.

She looked tired—dark circles under her eyes, hair pulled back messy, wearing old jeans and a sweater that was probably Betty's. But she was still Nina. Still beautiful. Still the girl I'd been in love with since she broke down in this truck stop parking lot and I helped her with a radiator hose.

She stared at me like I was a ghost.

"Ryan?"

"Hey." My voice came out rough.

"What are you—" She stopped, looked past me like she expected to see my Peterbilt in the driveway. "What are you doing here?"

"I came to see you. To talk. If that's okay."

Nina's expression shifted through a dozen emotions too fast to name. Surprise, confusion, hurt, hope, anger. She settled on guarded.

"It's six in the morning."

"I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't wait."

"Couldn't wait for what?"

To tell you I love you. To apologize for walking away. To ask if you'll give me another chance.

"Can I come in?" I asked. "Please?"

Nina hesitated. Looked back into the house where I could hear movement—Betty, probably, getting up. Then she stepped onto the porch, pulled the door mostly closed behind her.

"Not inside. Grandma Betty's having a good morning and I don't want to upset her." Nina crossed her arms against the cold. "Say what you came to say, Ryan."

Fair enough. I'd hurt her. She had every right to be guarded.

I took a breath. Let it out. Tried to find words for everything I needed to say.

"I was wrong," I started. "Four weeks ago when you said you couldn't do the goodbye cycle anymore, I thought you were asking me to leave. Thought I was doing what you wanted by staying away. But I was wrong. You weren't asking me to leave—you were asking me to stay."

Nina's eyes filled with tears. She blinked them back.

"And I didn't," I continued. "I walked away because I was scared. Scared of disappointing you, scared of not being enough, scared of building something real and having it fall apart. I've been running for two years, Nina. From my father's death, from my mother moving on, from anything that felt like commitment. The road was safe. Easy. Uncomplicated."

"And I was complicated," Nina said quietly.

"No. You were real. You were everything I wanted and everything I was terrified of wanting." I stepped closer. "I spent the past four weeks trying to convince myself that staying away was better. That giving you a clean break was the right thing. Know what I figured out?"

"What?"

"I was miserable. More miserable than I've been in two years. Because avoiding you didn't protect me from pain—it guaranteed it. Every mile I drove, every town that wasn't Junction City, every morning I woke up knowing you were here and I was somewhere else—it killed me."

A tear slid down Nina's cheek. She didn't wipe it away.

"I saw my future," I said. "Met a guy—Dale Cooper, long-haul driver, been on the road for thirty years. No wife, no kids, no home. Just truck stops and highway miles and regrets about the woman he didn't choose. That's what I was becoming, Nina. And I couldn't do it. Couldn't become him. Couldn't live with the regret of letting you go without fighting."

"So what are you saying?" Nina's voice was barely a whisper.

"I'm saying I made changes. Real ones, not just promises." I pulled out my wallet, found Mike Harrison's card, handed it to her. "I got off long-haul. Took a regional position with a company out of Kansas City. Shorter runs, home every few days. I'll be in Junction City as part of my regular route."

Nina stared at the card. "You quit long-haul?"

"Yeah. Yesterday was my last run."

"Ryan, that's—the road is everything to you."

"No." I said it firm. Certain. "You're everything to me. The road was just what I was hiding in."

Nina looked up, tears streaming now. "You really quit?"

"I got an apartment too. Kansas City, near the regional office. Six-month lease. It's small, barely has furniture yet, but it's mine. First permanent address I've had in two years." I took her hand. Cold fingers, shaking. "I'm not passing through anymore, Nina. I'm staying. Building a life. And I want—God, I want you to be part of it. If you'll have me. If I didn't mess this up too badly."

"Ryan—"

"I know I hurt you. I know walking away was the wrong move. I know four weeks is a long time and you might've moved on or decided you're better off without me." The words tumbled out, desperate. "But I had to try. Had to come here and tell you I love you and I'm sorry and I'm not running anymore. I'm all in, Nina. Completely. Terrifyingly. If you'll give me another chance."

Nina was crying openly now, and I couldn't tell if it was good crying or bad crying and it was killing me.

"Say something," I said. "Please."

"You quit long-haul," she repeated, like she couldn't quite believe it.

"Yeah."

"For me?"

"For us. For a life that's more than just highway miles and goodbye." I squeezed her hand. "I don't know if I'll be good at staying. Don't know if I'll mess this up. But I want to try, Nina. Want to be the kind of man who deserves you. Want to build something real instead of just passing through."

Nina pulled her hand free. My heart dropped.

Then she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around me, burying her face in my chest.

"You idiot," she said into my jacket. "You complete idiot."

I held her, hardly daring to breathe. "Is that a good idiot or a bad idiot?"

"Both." Nina pulled back enough to look at me, face wet with tears. "You really think I moved on in four weeks?"

"I didn't know. Hoped you hadn't."

"I tried." She laughed, but it came out choked. "God, I tried. Told myself you were right to walk away, that we were impossible, that I should just focus on Betty and forget about you. Know how well that worked?"

"How well?"

"Not at all. Every Tuesday I kept looking for your truck. Every time the phone rang I hoped it was you. Every night I lay awake wondering if I'd made a mistake, if I should've fought harder, if you were thinking about me too."

Relief hit me so hard my knees almost buckled.

"I thought about you constantly," I said. "Every single day. Every mile. You were all I could think about."

"Then why'd you stay away so long?"

"Because I needed to make real changes first. Needed to prove to myself I could do this—could get off the road, could build roots, could be what you need. Didn't want to show up empty-handed with just apologies." I cupped her face in my hands. "I'm here now. With an actual plan, an actual life. I'm staying, Nina. For real."

She stared at me for a long moment. Then she kissed me.

I pulled her closer, kissed her back, and everything that had been broken for four weeks suddenly felt whole again.

When we finally broke apart, both breathing hard, Nina rested her forehead against mine.

"Don't leave again," she whispered. "Don't run. I can't do another four weeks wondering if you're coming back."

"I'm not leaving. I'm staying right here."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

We stood there on Betty's porch while the sun came up over Junction City, holding each other like we could make up for four weeks of absence in one moment.

Inside, I heard Betty call for Nina.

"I should go," Nina said, but she didn't let go. "Grandma needs breakfast."

"I'll help."

"You don't have to—"

"I want to." I kissed her forehead. "I'm part of this now. Part of your life, part of Betty's care. Let me help."

Nina smiled—really smiled, for the first time since I'd shown up. "Okay."

We went inside together, and for the first time in two years, I felt like I was home.
