# Chapter 9: Summer Deepens

Late August arrives with heat that makes the Kansas prairie shimmer. The wheat's been harvested, fields cut low and golden. Summer's fading toward autumn, and my stops in Junction City are getting longer.

What started as an hour lunch has stretched to two hours. Then three. I find excuses to linger—slower truck inspection, coffee for the road, no rush to St. Louis. Excuses that fool nobody, least of all me.

This Thursday, Nina's shift at the Main Street Diner ends at two, and when I mention I'm staying in town a bit longer, she lights up.

"Want to walk Main Street with me?" she asks. "I need to pick up a prescription for Grandma Betty at the drugstore, and it's nice to have company."

"Sure."

We walk into downtown Junction City. Small town Main Street—two-story brick buildings, diagonal parking, American flags on lampposts. The courthouse sits in the square's center, benches under oak trees providing the only shade.

Nina knows everyone. Every few steps someone waves—"Hi, Nina," "How's Betty?" She responds with easy familiarity, introduces me as "my friend Ryan" without elaborating. People look at me with curiosity, but small-town politeness keeps them from asking directly.

I feel exposed. Visible. Known by association even if nobody knows my name.

"Is this weird?" Nina asks as we cross the street toward the drugstore. "Everyone staring?"

"Little bit."

"Sorry. That's small towns for you. A stranger walking with a local girl is basically front-page news."

"What are they thinking?"

"Probably that you're my boyfriend from out of town. Or wondering if you're trustworthy. Or both." She grins. "Don't worry. The fact that you helped me with my car is already common knowledge, so you've got a good reputation."

"News travels fast."

"Judy talks. And Judy knows everything."

At the drugstore—old-fashioned with a soda fountain—Nina picks up Betty's prescription while I browse magazines, feeling out of place among the locals.

"My treat," Nina says. "You've bought me lunch enough times. Ice cream's required at Miller's Drugstore."

At the counter, she orders butter pecan. I get chocolate.

"Boring choice," she teases.

"I'm a boring guy."

"You're really not."

We take our ice cream to the courthouse square, sit on a bench under an oak tree where the temperature drops maybe five degrees in the shade. Nina eats her ice cream slowly, watching people and cars pass, completely comfortable in the silence.

"This is my favorite spot in Junction City," she says eventually. "When I was a kid I used to come here after school and read on these benches. Felt like the whole world was happening around me but I could just observe it safely from here."

"You feel safe here."

"I feel... settled. Like I know who I am in this place. Even if I don't love being stuck here, at least it's familiar." She pauses. "Does that make sense?"

"Yeah. It makes sense."

A sheriff's cruiser pulls up. A man in uniform gets out—late fifties, solid build—and spots us. He walks over with the deliberate pace of law enforcement checking something out.

"Nina," he says when he reaches us. "Afternoon."

"Hi, Sheriff Hayes."

Sheriff Hayes studies me. "Don't believe we've met. You new in town?"

"Just passing through. I'm a trucker."

Nina explains. "He helped me when my car broke down. We've been friends since."

Friends. The word feels insufficient for whatever this is becoming.

Hayes studies me longer, then nods. "Any friend of Nina's is welcome. Just treat her right."

Not quite a threat, but close.

"Yes, sir."

He tips his hat and leaves. I exhale.

"Sorry about that," Nina says, though she's smiling. "Sheriff Hayes has known me since I was born. He's protective."

"I noticed."

"He's a good guy. Just takes his 'keeping the peace' job seriously."

We finish our ice cream and Nina checks her watch. "I should get back. Grandma will wonder where I am." She hesitates, then adds, "Unless... would you want to meet her? Grandma Betty, I mean. She keeps asking about 'the trucker boy' and I think she wants to make sure you're real."

Meeting her grandmother. That's a step toward something more serious, more real. That's the kind of thing you do when you're integrating into someone's life instead of just passing through it.

I should say no. Should stick to our truck stop meetings and keep this contained. But Nina's looking at me hopefully and I find myself saying, "Yeah. I'd like that."

The walk to Maple Street takes ten minutes through residential streets—old houses, lawns being watered, kids playing. Nina's grandmother lives in a white Victorian with green shutters and a wraparound porch.

"Fair warning," Nina says as we climb the porch steps. "Grandma has no filter. She's going to ask you invasive questions and won't feel bad about it."

"I can handle it."

Inside smells like lemon polish and cooking. In the kitchen, an elderly woman stirs a pot at the stove—small and slim, white hair in a bun. When she turns, her eyes are sharp and bright.

"Grandma Betty, this is Ryan. Ryan, my grandmother."

Betty sets down her spoon and looks me over with frank appraisal. "So you're the trucker who's been taking my granddaughter to lunch every two weeks."

"Yes, ma'am."

"Hmm." She continues studying me, and I feel like I'm being assessed more thoroughly than Sheriff Hayes managed. Finally she smiles. "You have kind eyes. I trust people with kind eyes. Would you like to stay for dinner? I made pot roast."

"I don't want to impose—"

"Nonsense. Nina, set an extra place. Ryan, you can help me carry things to the porch. We're eating outside tonight. Too hot to eat in the dining room."

There's no arguing with her tone, so I help carry dishes to the porch while Nina sets the table. Betty's made pot roast with potatoes and carrots, homemade rolls, lemonade so fresh the lemons are still on the counter. It's the kind of home cooking I haven't had since Dad died, and my chest aches a little at the familiar comfort of it.

We eat on the porch as evening arrives and the heat breaks. Betty asks questions—where I'm from, how long I've been driving—and I answer without getting too personal. She's sharp enough to notice what I'm not saying but doesn't push.

"Nina tells me you've been very good to her," Betty says over lemonade. "Fixing her car, buying her lunch, keeping her company. That means a lot to an old woman whose granddaughter doesn't have many friends her own age around anymore."

"Grandma—" Nina starts, embarrassed.

"It's true. All your school friends left for college or got married. You spend all your time at that diner or here with me. It's nice that you have someone to talk to besides breakfast customers and a seventy-two-year-old woman."

"I like talking to you," Nina protests.

"I know you do, sweetheart. But you should also have friends your own age." Betty turns to me. "You make her happy. I can tell. She smiles more on Thursdays."

The observation makes something warm unfold in my chest. I make her happy. She smiles more because of me.

"She makes me happy too," I say, and realize it's completely true.

After dinner, Nina insists on walking me back to the truck stop even though it's getting dark. We walk slowly through Junction City's quiet streets, fireflies blinking in yards, porch lights coming on in houses where families are settling in for the evening.

"Sorry if Grandma was too much," Nina says. "She doesn't get many visitors and she gets excited."

"She's great. I like her."

"She likes you too. She told me in the kitchen that you're 'a good one' and I should 'hold onto that boy.'" Nina laughs, but there's something nervous in it. "She's not subtle."

We reach the Crossroads Truck Stop and walk to where my Peterbilt is parked. The lot's quieter now, just a few trucks, the diner winding down for the evening. Above us, stars are starting to appear in the darkening sky.

We stand by my truck and neither of us seems to know what to say. The evening has shifted something between us—meeting Betty, Sheriff Hayes's assessment, ice cream on the courthouse square. We've crossed some invisible line from casual acquaintances to something more deliberate. More real.

"Thank you for staying," Nina says quietly. "For meeting Grandma. For the ice cream. For all of it."

"Thank you for inviting me."

Silence stretches between us, full of things neither of us is saying. I should get in the truck and go. Should stick to the safe script we've been following. But I don't want to leave, and Nina doesn't step back to let me.

Before I can talk myself out of it, I lean forward and kiss her cheek. Quick and uncertain, my lips barely brushing her skin. She smells like lemon and summer heat and something sweet I can't name.

When I pull back, Nina's eyes are wide, surprised but not unhappy. "Ryan—"

"I'll see you in two weeks," I say, then climb into my truck before I can do something stupid like kiss her properly or tell her how much these Thursdays mean to me.

I start the engine and pull out of the lot without looking back. Can't look back, because if I see her face I might turn around and that would complicate everything beyond repair.

Highway 40 stretches east through darkness, my headlights cutting through the night. The radio's off, just the rumble of the engine and the sound of tires on asphalt and my thoughts running too fast to catch.

I kissed her. Just her cheek, barely a kiss at all, but it counts. I crossed a line I'd been carefully avoiding, admitted through action what I've been denying with words.

I care about Nina Lawson. More than care. More than I've cared about anyone in two years.

And the highway feels lonelier than it ever has before—not because I'm alone, but because I left someone behind. Someone I want to go back to. Someone who makes Junction City feel more like home than anywhere I've lived since Dad died.

I'm in trouble. Deep trouble.

And I don't know what to do about it except count the days until I can go back.
