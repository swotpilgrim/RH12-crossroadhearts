# Chapter 1: Open Road

Highway 40 stretches east through Kansas like a promise I don't have to keep. The '54 Peterbilt rumbles beneath me, cab-over engine vibrating through the steering wheel, the whole rig humming with forward motion. I've got the window down despite the June heat because I like the sound of wind and road noise mixing together. No radio. Just the engine, the highway, and me.

That's how I prefer it.

The farmland rolling past is all golden wheat and blue sky, flat enough to see for miles in every direction. Silos rise in the distance, barns with faded paint, farmhouses set back from the road with windmills turning slow in the afternoon heat. It's the kind of landscape that makes some people feel small or lonely. Makes me feel free.

Two years I've been doing this. Two years since I turned eighteen and got my commercial license, started driving for Tommy Brennan's outfit out of Omaha. Two years of living out of the truck cab, duffel bag of clothes behind the seat, no permanent address beyond the dispatch office where they forward my mail. Not that I get much mail. Not that I want any.

I light a Camel with the dashboard lighter, shake out the match, watch the smoke get pulled out the window by the rushing air. The highway ahead is straight and empty, heat shimmer rising off the asphalt. I know this stretch by heart now. Done it maybe twenty times since I started the Omaha-to-St. Louis route. Highway 40, the old Lincoln Highway, crosses the whole damn country if you let it. I could keep driving east forever if I wanted. That's the thing about trucking—there's always another mile, another town, another delivery point. Always somewhere else to be.

That's why I like it.

Most guys my age are in college or working factory jobs in their hometowns, dating girls they've known since grade school, making plans for houses and kids and station wagons. Not me. I tried the hometown thing for exactly six months after my old man died, and that was six months too long.

Heart attack took him. Dad was forty-six, working construction, seemed healthy until he wasn't. Came home one afternoon complaining his arm hurt, sat down in his chair, and that was it. I was seventeen, just finished junior year. Mom was thirty-nine and suddenly a widow with a mortgage and a kid to raise.

She held it together maybe four months. Then Ben Thatcher started coming around.

Ben owned the hardware store, was divorced, had known my parents for years. Decent enough guy—brought casseroles, fixed things around the house. Mom smiled more when he was around. Six months after Dad died, she married him.

I was still grieving, still waking up expecting Dad's truck in the driveway, still setting three plates before I remembered. Suddenly there was Ben sleeping in Dad's bed, sitting in Dad's chair, talking about "our family" like I was part of some package deal I never agreed to.

I felt like a ghost in my own house. Unwanted. In the way.

So the week I turned eighteen, I got my commercial license and started driving for Tommy. Told Mom I'd gotten a job, needed to be on my own. She cried and said I could stay, that this was still my home. But it wasn't. Not anymore.

She's sent letters to Tommy's office—three or four over two years. I haven't opened them. Whatever she has to say won't change anything.

The dispatch radio crackles to life, Tommy's voice cutting through the static.

"Ryan, you copy?"

I reach for the handset. "Yeah, Tommy. I'm here."

"You're making good time. Should hit Junction City around six if you keep this pace."

"That's the plan."

"You staying the night or pushing through?"

I glance at the sun starting its slow descent toward the western horizon. "Staying. I'll catch some sleep, head out at first light."

"Sounds good. You've got the St. Louis delivery tomorrow afternoon, so no rush. Take your time."

"Will do."

"Drive safe, kid."

The radio clicks off. I hang the handset back on the dash and flick my cigarette out the window. Junction City is maybe an hour ahead now. I've been stopping there every two weeks for the past year, same routine every time. Pull in, eat dinner at the truck stop, sleep in the cab, wake up before dawn and get back on the road. Easy. Simple. No complications.

That's how I like things—simple.

The truck stop sits at the intersection of Highway 40 and Highway 77, right where the two roads cross through Junction City. It's a good setup: twenty-four-hour diner, gas pumps, garage bay if you need work done, and parking for maybe twenty big rigs. I usually roll in around dinner time, grab a meal, then settle into the cab for the night. Nobody bothers you if you're quiet and don't cause trouble.

Junction City itself is small-town Kansas. Population maybe three thousand, Main Street with a courthouse square, couple churches, a diner, drugstore. The kind of place where everyone knows everyone. Folks are polite when I stop for gas or food, but they know I'm passing through. That suits me fine.

I like Junction City because nobody knows me there. The waitress knows I take my coffee black and order the meatloaf special, but that's it. Doesn't ask questions. Just refills my cup and brings the check.

Attachment is what gets you hurt. Staying in one place means people start depending on you. And when you can't deliver—or when they decide you're not worth it—it tears you up. Better to keep moving.

The highway curves slightly as I approach Junction City, and I can see the truck stop's sign rising above the flatland—big red neon letters spelling out CROSSROADS, visible for miles. There's maybe six rigs in the lot already, diesels idling, drivers catching sleep or coffee before their next haul. I downshift, signal even though there's nobody behind me, and pull into the lot.

The parking maneuver is automatic—back the rig between two other Peterbilts, set the brake, kill the engine. The sudden silence is almost shocking. I can hear other trucks idling, distant highway traffic, the hum of neon signs. Early June twilight, sky still bright but the sun going orange.

I climb down, stretch my back, feel vertebrae pop after eight hours sitting. I light a Camel and walk a slow lap around the truck checking tires and cargo straps. Everything looks good. Tomorrow I'll fuel up and be back on the road by six.

But tonight, I'll eat.

Glass door with a cowbell rings when I push through. Inside smells like coffee and grease and pie. Red vinyl booths line the windows, Formica counter with swivel stools down the middle. The jukebox in the corner plays Elvis, "All Shook Up" competing with the clatter of dishes.

I take a stool at the counter, third from the end. The waitress glances over—maybe forty, bottle-blonde—and nods like she recognizes me. I've been stopping here long enough.

"Coffee?" she asks, already reaching for the pot.

"Yeah. Thanks."

She flips over a cup and pours it full, black and steaming. "You want the usual?"

"Meatloaf special sounds good."

"You got it, honey."

She clips the order and moves down the counter. I doctor my coffee with two sugars and look around without really seeing it. Other truckers scattered at the counter. A couple farmers in dusty overalls. Everyone minding their own business, separate lives briefly overlapping before diverging again.

That's what I like about truck stops. Everyone's just passing through.

The meatloaf arrives—thick slab with brown gravy, mashed potatoes, overcooked green beans. I eat methodically, just fueling up. When you eat at diners every day, one meatloaf tastes like every other. It's about the routine.

When I'm done I leave a decent tip—not so much it's memorable, not so little it's rude—and pay the check at the register by the door. The waitress thanks me without really looking at me. I step back outside into the parking lot, where full darkness has settled now and the neon signs are bright against the black sky.

My truck sits where I left it, solid and familiar. Home, if I'm being honest with myself. I climb back into the cab, pull the curtain closed behind the seats, and stretch out on the narrow bunk with my boots still on. The sleeping bag smells like diesel and cigarette smoke and two years of road dirt, but it's mine.

Through the thin curtain I can hear the low rumble of other trucks idling, the distant sound of the highway, voices of other drivers out in the lot. Above it all, the stars are probably bright—Kansas stars always are—but I don't look. I just close my eyes and let the familiar sounds wrap around me.

This is my life. The highway, the truck, the endless motion from one point to another. No attachments, no complications, no risk of being unwanted or replaced. Just me and the road and the freedom to leave whenever I want.

In two weeks I'll be back here, same routine. Same diner, same meal, same parking spot. And that's fine. The predictability of it is comforting. I'm not looking for anything more than this.

I don't need anything more than this.

I tell myself that's true as I drift toward sleep, the sound of distant highway traffic like a lullaby I've learned by heart.
