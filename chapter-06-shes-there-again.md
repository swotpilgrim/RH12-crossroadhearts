# Chapter 6: She's There Again

I pull into Junction City right on schedule—twelve-thirty on a Thursday, early July heat making the asphalt shimmer. The Crossroads Truck Stop looks exactly the same as it did two weeks ago. Predictable. Comfortable.

I park my rig in the third row and kill the engine. The silence after eight hours of road noise is jarring. I can hear other trucks idling, the hum of the diner's air conditioning working overtime.

Lunch time. I need to eat, fuel up, and be back on the road within an hour if I want to make St. Louis before dark.

Inside, the diner is busy. Almost every booth is full—farmers, truckers, a few townspeople. The lunch rush. I spot an empty stool at the counter and take it.

Judy swings by almost immediately.

"Hey there, stranger," she says with a grin. "The usual?"

I have to think about what the usual even is. Burger and fries? Meatloaf? Apparently I've been here enough times that I have a usual now. That should probably bother me more than it does.

"Roast beef sandwich," I say, changing it up. "And coffee."

"You got it, honey."

She pours the coffee first—black, steaming, strong enough to strip paint—and clips my order to the carousel for the cook. I doctor the coffee with two sugars and take a long drink, feeling the caffeine start to work its way into my system. Better.

Through the window I can see Highway 40 stretching west, trucks and cars passing. Always moving, always going somewhere.

I'm halfway through my coffee when the bell over the door rings. I don't look up at first, but something makes me glance toward the door.

It's her.

Nina. The girl from the broken-down Chevy. Walking into the diner with a small purse over her shoulder, dark hair pulled back, wearing a different sundress than last time—yellow with little flowers. She looks like she's on a lunch break, the slightly hurried air of someone who only has so much time before they need to be back somewhere.

I recognize her immediately, which surprises me. Two weeks ago I told myself I'd forget her face, forget her name, forget the whole encounter. But here she is and I know exactly who she is without hesitation.

Nina scans the diner looking for a seat. The booths are all full, the counter mostly occupied. Her gaze sweeps past me, then stops, comes back. Recognition lights her face.

"Oh," she says, walking over. "Hi. You're... you helped with my car. Two weeks ago."

"Yeah. Hi."

"Ryan, right?"

I'm surprised she remembers my name. "Right. Nina."

Her smile widens like she's pleased I remembered hers too. "Small world. Or I guess small town." She glances around the crowded diner, then back at me. "Do you mind if I sit here? Everything else is full."

I should say no. Should tell her I'm just grabbing a quick meal and heading out, that I eat alone, that she should wait for a booth to open up. But the stool next to me is empty and she's standing there looking hopeful and I can't think of a good reason to refuse that won't make me sound like a jerk.

"Sure," I hear myself say.

"Thanks." She slides onto the stool beside me, sets her purse on the counter. Judy appears immediately like she's been watching the whole interaction.

"Well, look at this," Judy says with barely concealed amusement. "You two know each other?"

"He fixed my car," Nina explains. "Couple weeks ago when it overheated in your parking lot."

"That's right! I remember now." Judy winks at me, then turns to Nina. "What can I get you, hon?"

"Just a Coke and fries, please. I don't have long."

"Coming right up."

Judy moves off and Nina turns to me, her expression open and friendly. "So what brings you back to Junction City? Besides..." She gestures vaguely at the diner. "You know. Lunch."

"I'm a trucker. This is one of my regular stops."

"Oh, that's right. You mentioned that. How often do you come through?"

"Every two weeks, usually. Omaha to St. Louis route."

"And you always stop here?"

"Most times. It's a good midpoint."

My sandwich arrives and Nina's Coke and fries show up right after. We eat in companionable silence for a minute, and I'm hyperaware of her sitting next to me. Not uncomfortable. Just aware.

"How's your car?" I ask, because that seems like the logical question.

"Good! I took it to the shop that same day, like you said. They replaced the radiator hose and checked everything else. Said your tape job was actually pretty solid—it would've held for a while if I'd needed it to."

"Good to know."

"I should've asked where to find you so I could pay you back for helping. For the tape and your time."

"I told you, it wasn't anything."

"It was to me. I was having a really bad day and you turned it around." She pauses, then adds, "Thank you. Again. I know I said it then but it bears repeating."

"You're welcome."

We fall back into silence. I eat methodically, trying not to notice how easy this feels. Usually proximity with strangers is awkward. But this feels normal.

"So where do you live?" Nina asks. "When you're not driving, I mean. Do you have an apartment somewhere?"

"Not really. I stay in boarding houses sometimes, or sleep in the truck. I don't have what you'd call a permanent address."

She looks surprised. "You just live on the road?"

"Pretty much."

"That sounds..." She seems to search for the right word. "Lonely."

I shrug. "It's simple. No rent, no utilities, no one depending on me to be anywhere specific."

"But no home either."

"The truck's home."

Nina studies me for a long moment, like she's trying to figure something out. Then she says, "I guess I can see the appeal. No responsibilities, no one telling you what to do, just you and the highway."

"Exactly."

"Still seems lonely though."

I don't have a good answer for that, so I just take another bite of my sandwich. Nina tries one of her fries, makes a face.

"These are always better at my diner," she says.

"You work at a diner?"

"Main Street Diner, yeah. Just a few blocks from here. I work the breakfast and lunch shift."

"Is that why you're here instead of there?"

She grins. "Can't eat where you work. You get sick of the menu real fast. I come here on my lunch breaks sometimes, just for the change of scenery."

"Makes sense."

"Plus," she adds, "the company's better today than usual."

It takes me a second to realize she means me, and I don't know what to do with that. Is she flirting? Being friendly? I'm not good at reading these signals. Haven't had to be.

"So what about you?" I ask, deflecting. "You from Junction City originally?"

"Born and raised. Graduated high school last year, been working at the diner ever since." She pauses. "My parents moved to California for work, left me here with my grandmother."

"They just left you?"

"Grandma Betty didn't want to leave. She's lived in Junction City her whole life, and she's got health problems—heart trouble, mostly. My parents wanted her to come with them or go into a nursing home, but she refused both. So I stayed to take care of her."

"That's... a lot of responsibility for someone your age."

Nina shrugs, but I can see something complicated pass behind her eyes. "She raised my dad. It's the least I can do. And it's not forever. Eventually she'll either get better or..." She doesn't finish the sentence. "Anyway. It is what it is."

I respect that—the quiet acceptance of a difficult situation, the lack of complaint. A lot of people would whine about being stuck in a small town taking care of an elderly relative. Nina just states it as fact and moves on.

"That's decent of you," I say.

"Or stupid, depending on who you ask." But she smiles when she says it, like she's made peace with her choice.

Judy swings by to refill my coffee and check if we need anything else. When she leaves, Nina glances at the clock on the wall and sighs.

"I should get back. My break's almost over." She pulls out her wallet but I wave her off.

"I got it."

"You don't have to—"

"It's just fries and a Coke. Don't worry about it."

She looks like she wants to argue, but she just says, "Thank you. For lunch and for the conversation. This was nice."

"Yeah. It was."

And the weird thing is, I mean it. It was nice. Talking to someone who isn't another trucker or a dispatcher, someone who asks questions and listens to the answers, someone who doesn't treat me like just another customer passing through.

Nina slides off the stool, gathers her purse. "If you're ever in Junction City again and want company for lunch, I'm usually here around this time. On Thursdays especially."

"I might take you up on that."

"I hope you do."

She gives me a little wave and heads for the door. I watch her go, then turn back to my sandwich. But I'm not really seeing it anymore. I'm thinking about Nina—the way she smiled, the way she talked about her grandmother, the way she said "I hope you do" like she actually meant it.

When I finish eating I pay both checks despite Judy's knowing grin, and head back to my truck. The afternoon heat is thick and oppressive, but I barely notice. I'm still thinking about lunch, about the conversation, about Nina saying she hoped I'd come back.

I climb into the cab, start the engine, pull out onto Highway 40 heading east. The road stretches ahead, familiar and endless and exactly the same as always.

But something's different.

I remember Nina this time. Remember her smile, her laugh, the way she tilted her head when she was thinking. Remember the whole conversation instead of just vague details that will fade by tomorrow.

And more than that—I want to remember. Want to hold onto this instead of letting it blur and disappear the way encounters usually do.

That should worry me. Does worry me, a little. But mostly I'm just thinking about two weeks from now, when my route brings me back through Junction City.

Wondering if she'll be there again.

Kind of hoping she will be.
