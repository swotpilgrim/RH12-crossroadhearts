# Chapter 18: Nina's Side

I was somewhere in Nebraska when I realized I hadn't stopped thinking about her in three days.

Nina.

The route took me north through Lincoln and Grand Island, hauling farm equipment to Scottsbluff. Flatland and sky for miles, nothing but highway and the occasional town breaking up the monotony. Usually I liked this kind of run—uncomplicated, straightforward, plenty of time to think or not think, whatever suited me.

But this time my head wouldn't shut up.

I kept seeing Nina in that truck cab, rain drumming overhead, her hand on my jaw. Kept hearing her voice shaking when she said _I'm falling for you_. Kept feeling the weight of what I'd done—kissing her like that, admitting without words that I was in too deep to pretend anymore.

And then I'd driven away. Because that's what I did. That's who I was.

But for the first time in two years, driving away felt wrong.

I stopped at a truck stop outside North Platte for gas and bad coffee. The waitress reminded me of Nina—not in looks, but in the way she moved through the diner like she'd done it a thousand times. Small-town girl, probably saving for something bigger.

But Nina didn't want somewhere else. She was stuck in Junction City because of Betty, because of duty and the kind of loyalty most people didn't have. She could've gone to California, put her grandmother in a home, started fresh.

But she wouldn't. Nina saw that as abandonment, and she wasn't built that way.

I respected the hell out of that. But it also meant Nina wasn't going anywhere. Junction City was her cage and her choice, both at once.

And I was the drifter who rolled through every two weeks and complicated her life.

I got back on the road.

Highway 26 stretched west through prairie grass. I tried to imagine what Nina was doing—probably at the diner serving eggs and coffee, or home with Betty, checking medications, making sure she ate.

Nina's whole life was taking care of people. And I was making it harder.

Because that's what this was, wasn't it? Every time I showed up in Junction City, every lunch we shared, every phone call from a pay phone in some nowhere town—I was making Nina's life more complicated. Making her want things she couldn't have. Making her hope for a future that didn't make sense with the logistics we were working with.

I was always leaving. She was always staying. And loving each other didn't change the math.

The thought sat heavy in my chest.

I wondered if Nina was thinking the same thing. If she was going through her shifts wondering how this was supposed to work. If she lay awake at night listening to Betty's labored breathing, asking herself if loving a trucker was smart or stupid.

Probably stupid.

But Nina didn't do things halfway. If she said she was falling for me, she meant it. Which meant she was hurting too—caught between wanting me and knowing she couldn't ask me to give up everything, between hoping I'd stay and protecting herself from when I drove away for good.

I hated that I was doing that to her. Hated that every goodbye hurt more than the last one. Hated that I didn't know how to make this better.

I reached Scottsbluff at sunset, delivered my load, found a spot to park.

Tommy had another run tomorrow—Scottsbluff to Cheyenne, then Denver. After that I'd loop back east, hit Junction City in five days.

Five days until I saw Nina again.

I sat in the cab as darkness fell, trying to figure out what I'd say when I saw her.

_Hey, I love you but I don't know how to stay._

_I think about you constantly but I'm terrified of disappointing you._

_You deserve better than a guy who lives out of a truck and doesn't know how to commit to anything except the next mile of highway._

None of it sounded right. None of it would fix the fundamental problem—we were impossible.

I imagined Nina with Judy at the diner during a slow afternoon. Judy would ask about "your trucker," and Nina would smile and say "It's fine. It's good."

And Judy would see right through it. She'd probably say some relationships were only meant to last a season, that you had to enjoy what you had while it lasted.

Practical advice. Smart advice.

But Nina didn't want temporary. I could see it in her eyes every time I left Junction City—the way she watched my truck pull away, the way her smile didn't quite reach her eyes when we said goodbye. She wanted more than two-week increments. Wanted something real and permanent.

Wanted me to choose her instead of the highway.

And God, I wanted to give her that. Wanted to walk into Tommy's office and say _I'm done with long-haul_. Wanted to find an apartment in Junction City, wake up next to Nina, build an actual life.

But wanting and knowing how were different things.

I'd been running for two years. Before that, drowning in grief, watching my mother replace my father. The road had been escape, then freedom, then identity. All I knew anymore—keep moving, keep the past behind me, never let anyone matter enough to hurt.

Except Nina mattered. She mattered so much it scared the hell out of me.

And I had no idea what to do with that.

My mother's letter sat in the glove box, unopened. Three weeks now. I could see my name in her handwriting—_Ryan Michael Cross_—but couldn't make myself read it.

What would she say? That she missed me? Wanted me home for Thanksgiving? Worried about me living on the road with no permanent address, no future beyond the next route?

She'd be right to worry. But I couldn't explain that the road felt safer than home, that motion felt less dangerous than stillness.

Except I'd fallen in love anyway. With a Kansas truck stop girl who saw through my walls and made me want things I'd been running from.

Nina's parents called her every week from California. I knew because she'd mentioned it—how they kept asking when she was coming to join them, how they didn't understand why she wouldn't put Betty in a home. How they meant well but didn't see that Nina couldn't abandon her grandmother.

I wondered what Nina told them about me. If she mentioned me at all, or if she kept me separate, private, something she wasn't ready to explain. _There's this trucker who stops through Junction City every two weeks. We have lunch together. I'm in love with him but he's always leaving and I don't know what to do about it._

Yeah, that would go over well.

Her father would probably tell her the same thing Judy would—that truckers made lousy boyfriends, that Nina deserved someone stable, someone local, someone who could actually be there. And he'd be right. Nina did deserve that.

She deserved someone who could stay.

I stubbed out my cigarette and leaned back against the seat, closing my eyes. The truck cab was dark except for the parking lot lights filtering through the windshield. Somewhere nearby another truck's engine idled, a low rumble that was almost comforting in its familiarity.

This had been home for two years. But it didn't feel like home anymore.

I didn't know what home felt like, actually. Maybe I never had. My father's death had shattered whatever sense of home I'd had, and my mother's remarriage had finished the job. The road was just what I'd chosen instead—endless motion instead of painful stillness.

But Nina made me wonder if home wasn't a place at all. If maybe it was a person. If maybe home was the truck stop booth where she waited, the sound of her laugh, the way she tucked loose hair behind her ear when she was nervous.

If maybe I'd been looking for home in all the wrong places, and it had been in Junction City all along.

The thought should've been comforting. Instead it terrified me.

Because if Nina was home, that meant staying. That meant building a life in Junction City, giving up long-haul, becoming the kind of man who had roots and routines and responsibilities. That meant risking everything I'd been protecting myself from—disappointment, failure, the gut-wrenching pain of not being enough.

I'd failed my mother. Couldn't be what she needed after Dad died, couldn't accept her moving forward when I was still stuck in grief.

What made me think I wouldn't fail Nina too?

Five days until Junction City. Five days until I had to look Nina in the eye and figure out if I was brave enough to try, or if I was just going to keep running until there was nothing left to run from.

I didn't sleep well that night. And when morning came and I pointed the Peterbilt toward Cheyenne, the highway felt more like a prison than freedom.

Because with every mile I drove, I knew I was either moving toward Nina or away from her.

And I still didn't know which one scared me more.
