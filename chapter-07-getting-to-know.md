# Chapter 7: Getting to Know

Two weeks later, I time my arrival into Junction City for twelve-thirty. Tell myself it's because that's when I'm hungry, when the lunch rush is winding down. Not because it's when Nina said she's usually here. Not because I'm hoping to see her again.

But I am hoping.

The realization sits uncomfortable in my chest as I park the rig and walk toward the diner. I shouldn't be hoping for anything. Shouldn't be looking forward to Junction City more than other stops. Shouldn't have spent the last two weeks thinking about dark eyes and a yellow sundress and the way she said she hoped I'd come back.

But I did. And here I am.

Inside, the diner's moderately busy—a few truckers, some farmers, the usual crowd. I scan the booths automatically and there she is. Nina, sitting in a back corner booth with a book and a half-empty Coke. She's wearing jeans and a white blouse, hair loose around her shoulders, and she looks up when the bell rings.

Our eyes meet across the diner. Her face lights up—there's no other way to describe it—and she waves me over with a smile that makes something warm and dangerous unfold in my chest.

I'm in trouble. I know I'm in trouble. But I walk over anyway.

"You came back," she says, closing her book as I approach.

"I come through every two weeks. Like I said."

"I know. But I didn't know if you'd..." She gestures at the empty seat across from her. "Want to sit?"

I should say I'm just grabbing food to go. Should make an excuse about being on a tight schedule. Should keep this casual and unmemorable.

"Yeah," I hear myself say. "Thanks."

I slide into the booth and Nina's smile gets wider. Judy appears almost immediately, coffee pot in hand and knowing smirk firmly in place.

"Well, well," she says. "Look who's back. The usual, hon?"

"Meatloaf special sounds good."

"You got it." She turns to Nina. "You eating, sweetie, or just drinking that Coke all afternoon?"

"I'll have a BLT. Thanks, Judy."

Judy pours my coffee, refills Nina's Coke, and heads back to the kitchen. Nina props her chin on her hand and looks at me with open curiosity.

"So. Ryan the trucker. Tell me about yourself."

"Not much to tell."

"Oh, come on. Everyone has a story. Where are you from originally?"

"Southern Illinois. Small town you've never heard of."

"Family there?"

The question hits a nerve I usually keep well-protected. "My mom. And her husband."

Something in my tone makes Nina's expression shift, gentle and understanding. "Not your dad?"

"He died. Two years ago."

"I'm sorry."

I shrug, uncomfortable with sympathy. "It happens."

"Still hard though."

"Yeah."

There's a brief silence, not awkward but weighted. Then Nina seems to sense I don't want to talk about it and switches topics.

"What made you become a trucker?"

"Needed a job. Liked the idea of traveling."

"You don't seem like the kind of person who needs a reason to avoid talking about himself," she observes with a slight smile. "But I'll let it slide. For now."

I can't help a small grin. "Appreciated."

"So if you won't tell me about you, at least tell me about the places you've been. What's the most interesting city you've driven through?"

And just like that, we're in safer territory. I tell her about Denver with the mountains rising behind it, about the chaos of Kansas City's stockyards, about sleeping in my truck in a rest stop outside Cheyenne while a thunderstorm raged overhead. Nina listens like she's genuinely interested, asks questions, laughs at the right parts.

Our food arrives and we eat while talking. The conversation flows easier than last time, natural and comfortable. I realize I'm doing most of the talking for once—usually I'm the one asking questions, keeping the focus off myself. But Nina has a way of making me want to share things, even if I'm careful about what I share.

"What about you?" I finally ask when there's a lull. "You said you're from Junction City. Always lived here?"

"Born and raised. Graduated from Junction City High last June."

"And then what? You just started working at the diner?"

Nina takes a bite of her sandwich, chews thoughtfully. "That's the plan that wasn't really a plan. My parents moved to California last summer—my dad got a job with an aircraft company in Los Angeles. Good money, good opportunity. They wanted me to come with them."

"But you stayed."

"But I stayed." She pauses, and I can see her choosing her words carefully. "My grandmother—my dad's mom—she lives here. Has lived here her whole life, actually. In the same house on Maple Street where she and my grandfather raised my dad. She's seventy-two now, and she's got heart problems. Dizzy spells, breathlessness, the doctor says she needs to avoid stress."

"And your parents wanted her to come to California?"

"Or go into a nursing home. They gave her the options. But Grandma Betty—she's stubborn. She said she's lived in Junction City for fifty years and she'll die in Junction City, and they could pack her off to California or a nursing home over her dead body."

I can't help smiling at that. "She sounds like a character."

"She is. She's wonderful and stubborn and she absolutely refused to leave. So someone had to stay with her." Nina shrugs. "I volunteered."

"That's a lot to take on. You're what, eighteen?"

"Seventeen. I'll be eighteen in December."

"Even more of a lot, then."

Nina looks down at her plate, and I catch something complicated in her expression. "Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice. My parents call every Sunday and ask when I'm coming to California. My friends from high school are all off at college or got married or left for bigger cities. And I'm here, working at a diner, taking care of my grandmother, watching my life stay exactly the same while everyone else's moves forward."

"You could still go. To California, I mean."

"I could. But I won't. Not while Grandma needs me." She looks back up, and there's determination in her eyes mixed with something sadder. "She raised my dad. She's family. And family doesn't abandon each other when things get hard."

There's weight in those words, like she's trying to convince herself as much as tell me. I recognize the feeling—the way you tell yourself the story of your life until you almost believe it's the truth.

"That's decent of you," I say, meaning it.

"Or stupid, depending on your perspective." But she smiles. "Anyway. That's my exciting life. Junction City waitress, devoted granddaughter, living the dream."

"You don't sound happy about it."

"I don't sound unhappy either. I'm just... here. It is what it is."

The resignation in her voice bothers me more than it should. Nina's seventeen, smart and funny and pretty, stuck in a small Kansas town taking care of an elderly relative while her peers are out living their lives. She should be annoyed about it, angry maybe. Instead she's just... accepting.

"What would you do?" I ask. "If you could do anything. If you weren't here."

Nina blinks, surprised by the question. "I don't know. I used to think about it all the time—college, maybe, or traveling, seeing places that aren't Junction City. But thinking about it just makes staying harder, so I stopped."

"That doesn't answer the question."

She considers this, playing with her straw. "I guess... I'd want to see the ocean. I've never seen the ocean. California has the ocean, which is ironic since my parents are there and I'm not." She laughs, but it sounds hollow. "What about you? If you could do anything besides drive a truck, what would it be?"

"I don't think about hypotheticals."

"Why not?"

"Because they don't change reality. I drive trucks. That's what I do. Wondering about what-ifs doesn't help anything."

Nina studies me for a long moment. "We're both really good at lying to ourselves, aren't we?"

The observation is uncomfortably accurate. "Maybe."

"You tell yourself you're fine living out of a truck with no home and no attachments. I tell myself I'm fine being stuck in Junction City with no future plans. And we're both probably full of it."

I don't know what to say to that. She's right, but admitting it feels dangerous.

Judy comes by to refill our drinks and drop the check. I grab it before Nina can reach for it.

"You don't have to keep paying for my meals," she protests.

"It's just a BLT."

"Last time it was fries and a Coke. This time it's a whole sandwich. At this rate you're going to go broke feeding me."

"I'll take my chances."

She shakes her head but she's smiling. "At least let me get it next time."

"There's going to be a next time?"

"I hope so. I mean... if you want. If you're passing through again."

"I'm always passing through. Every two weeks."

"Then yeah. Next time."

There's something in the way she says it—hopeful and hesitant at the same time—that makes my chest feel tight. This is dangerous territory. I know it is. Getting to know her, looking forward to seeing her, making plans for "next time." That's how attachment starts. That's how you end up caring about someone enough that it hurts when you leave.

But I'm already in it, aren't I? Already thinking about two weeks from now, already hoping I'll see her again, already remembering every detail of this conversation so I can replay it later when I'm alone in the truck cab.

"I should get back on the road," I say, standing up. "Still have a few hours to St. Louis."

"Drive safe."

"Always do."

I pay the check at the register—Judy gives me that knowing look again but doesn't comment—and head outside. The July heat is oppressive but I barely notice. I'm thinking about Nina saying we're both good at lying to ourselves, about the way she looked when she talked about the ocean, about how easy it is to talk to her.

Too easy. Dangerously easy.

I climb into my truck, start the engine, pull out onto Highway 40. The road stretches east, familiar and reliable and exactly the same as always.

But I'm different. Something's shifting inside me, something I don't know how to stop or if I even want to. Two weeks ago I told myself I'd forget Nina Lawson's name. Now I'm counting the days until I see her again.

That should scare me more than it does.

Maybe Nina's right. Maybe we're both really good at lying to ourselves.

And maybe I'm starting to run out of lies to tell.
