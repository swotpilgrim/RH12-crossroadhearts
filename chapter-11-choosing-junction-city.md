# Chapter 11: Choosing Junction City

Early September brings cooler mornings and hints that summer's ending. The Kansas prairie shifts from gold to brown, heat finally breaking. And I'm making choices I never thought I'd make.

Tommy calls me into his office with another opportunity—third this month.

"Got a request for a Chicago-to-Indianapolis run," he says, shuffling papers on his desk. "Four times a week, better pay than your current route, union benefits. Guy who had it just quit. Position's yours if you want it."

Chicago to Indianapolis. Nowhere near Junction City. Nowhere near Kansas at all.

"I'm good with what I've got," I say.

Tommy leans back, studies me. "That's the third time you've turned down better opportunities. What's going on?"

"I like my route."

"Comfortable doesn't pay bills or build futures. You're twenty—you should be jumping at these opportunities, not running the same road over and over."

I don't have a good answer that doesn't involve admitting why I need that particular road, why Junction City matters more than better pay or union benefits. So I just shrug.

"The Omaha-St. Louis route works for me. That's all."

Tommy sighs, pulls off his glasses. "It's a girl, isn't it? In Junction City."

The fact that he's figured it out shouldn't surprise me, but it does. "What makes you say that?"

"Because I've been dispatching trucks for fifteen years and I know what it looks like when a driver gets attached to a specific route. It's never about the road—it's about what's on it." He pauses. "So yeah? There's a girl?"

"Yeah. There's a girl."

"She worth it?"

I think about Nina. About Thursday afternoons and stolen conversations and the way she makes me want to be someone better than I've been. About pot roast on Betty's porch and ice cream on the courthouse square and that quick kiss that I can still feel days later.

"Yeah," I say. "She's worth it."

Tommy nods slowly, like this confirms something he already suspected. "All right then. Just... be careful, kid. I've seen this story before. Trucker falls for a townie, tries to make it work long-distance, ends up breaking both their hearts when the logistics don't pan out. Make sure you know what you're getting into."

"I will."

But the truth is, I don't know what I'm getting into. I just know I can't stop.

Back in my truck, I pull out my road atlas and a pencil. I've been doing this lately—calculating routes down to the minute, figuring out exactly when I'll hit Junction City based on traffic and weather and how fast I can push the truck without attracting highway patrol attention. Obsessive, maybe. But I need to know I'll arrive during Nina's lunch break, need to time it perfectly so I don't miss her.

This week I calculate I can leave Omaha at seven a.m., average fifty-five on Highway 40, hit Junction City by twelve-fifteen. Give myself fifteen minutes of buffer for unexpected delays. Should put me at the Crossroads by twelve-thirty, right when Nina's breaking for lunch.

I'm planning my life around a seventeen-year-old girl's work schedule. That should probably worry me more than it does.

At a rest stop outside Lincoln, I run into Dale Cooper. He waves, walks over.

"Still running that same route?"

"Yeah. Omaha-St. Louis."

He lights a cigarette. "You get comfortable with it?"

There's that word again. Comfortable. Like it's something to avoid instead of something to want.

"It's a good route," I say, defensive.

"I'm sure it is. But I've been watching you, kid. Something's changed. You used to have that look—you know, the highway look. Eyes always on the next mile, mind already gone before your body catches up. Now you look... settled. Like you're driving toward something instead of away from it."

He's more perceptive than I gave him credit for. "Maybe I am."

"Let me guess. Junction City?"

I don't answer, which is answer enough.

Dale shakes his head. "I warned you about this. About getting attached to places, to people. The road's supposed to set you free, not tie you down."

"Maybe I don't want to be free anymore. Not that kind of free, anyway."

"Then what do you want?"

It's a simple question with a complicated answer I'm still figuring out. "I don't know yet. But I know it's not this—driving the same roads alone, eating in empty diners, sleeping in truck cabs and pretending that's freedom instead of just loneliness."

Dale studies me for a long moment. "You're young. You'll figure it out. Just don't give up everything you've got for someone who might not be there when you finally stop moving."

He heads back to his truck, leaving me standing there with his warning echoing in my head. The thing is, I know he's trying to help. Know he's seen drivers make mistakes, fall for the wrong people, throw away good lives chasing something that doesn't work out.

But Nina's not a mistake. She's the first thing that's felt right since Dad died.

Next day I stop at a truck stop outside Topeka and browse the general store. There's a clothing rack near the back. I find a blue button-down cleaner than my usual t-shirts, and a leather jacket that doesn't smell like diesel.

I buy both, tell myself it's practical. But I know the truth—I'm trying to look like someone worth Nina's time.

When I arrive in Junction City that Thursday, I'm wearing the new shirt. Nina's already at our booth, and when I slide in across from her, she notices immediately.

"Well, look at you," she says with a smile. "Did you dress up for me?"

"It's just a shirt."

"It's a nice shirt. Blue looks good on you."

I can feel myself getting embarrassed, which is ridiculous. "Thanks."

"You didn't have to do that, you know. I like you just fine in your regular clothes."

"Maybe I wanted to make an effort."

Nina's smile softens into something that makes my chest tight. "I appreciate it. Really."

We order lunch—I'm branching out from meatloaf, try the pot roast special—and fall into easy conversation. But today feels different somehow. More weighted. Like we're both aware we're building toward something neither of us has named yet.

Halfway through the meal, I make a decision.

"My truck's making a weird noise," I lie. "Think I should have the mechanic here take a look at it. Might take a few hours."

Nina's eyes light up. "So you'll be staying longer?"

"Looks that way."

"Good. Because I actually have the rest of the day off. Judy's covering my afternoon shift."

After lunch, we walk to the creek outside town—a small tributary that feeds into the Kansas River, lined with cottonwood trees and tall grass. It's quiet out here, just the sound of water moving over rocks and birds calling in the trees. We find a spot on the bank where someone's left an old log for sitting, and we settle in to watch the water flow.

"I've been coming here since I was a kid," Nina says. "It's my escape spot. Where I go when Junction City feels too small and I need to remember there's a whole world beyond it."

"You think about leaving a lot?"

"Used to. Before Grandma needed me. I'd sit here and imagine all the places I'd go—California to see my parents, maybe New York or Chicago, somewhere big and exciting where I could be someone besides 'Nina Lawson from Junction City.'" She picks up a pebble, tosses it into the water. "Now I mostly just think about getting through the day."

"That's not a life. That's just... existing."

"I know. But it's the hand I was dealt." She turns to look at me. "What about you? What do you want from life? Not what you're running from—you never talk about that. But what are you running toward?"

It's the same question Dale asked me, the same question I've been avoiding for two years. What do I want?

"I don't know," I admit. "I've spent so long just trying to survive, to not feel anything too much, that I never stopped to think about what I actually want. Just what I don't want."

"And what's that? What don't you want?"

"To be disappointed again. To count on someone and have them leave. To matter to someone and then find out I'm not worth sticking around for." The words come out raw, more honest than I meant them to be. "My dad died and my mom replaced him in six months. I felt like I didn't matter enough for her to wait, to grieve with me instead of moving on without me. So I left before she could make me leave."

Nina's quiet for a moment, then she says softly, "You matter to me. You know that, right?"

The words hit me square in the chest. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. These Thursdays—they're the best part of my week. Maybe the best part of my life right now. You make Junction City feel less like a trap and more like a place worth being." She pauses. "I know we haven't... I mean, we've never talked about what this is. But whatever it is, it's important to me. You're important to me."

I don't know what to say to that. Don't know how to explain that she's become the most important thing in my life, that I'm rearranging everything around these brief encounters, that I'm halfway in love with her and terrified of what that means.

So I just take her hand. Her fingers are small and warm in mine, and we sit there by the creek in comfortable silence, watching the water flow and the afternoon light filter through the cottonwood leaves.

This is what I want, I realize. This. Not the highway, not the endless motion, not the freedom that's really just running dressed up in better clothes. This—sitting by a creek with someone who matters, being somewhere that feels like more than just another stop.

Maybe staying is what I've wanted all along. I just needed a reason good enough to try.

Nina squeezes my hand, and I squeeze back, and for the first time in two years I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

Even if I don't know how to make it last.

Even if the logistics are impossible.

Even if choosing this means giving up everything I've built my identity around.

I'm choosing Junction City. I'm choosing Nina.

Now I just have to figure out what that means.
