# Chapter 5: On Schedule

Two weeks pass the way they always do. The way they have for two years now—one mile blurring into the next, one town fading into another, the highway and the truck and the endless forward motion that defines everything.

I make my runs. Omaha to St. Louis and back. Kansas City to Des Moines with a refrigerated load that keeps me checking the temperature gauge every hour. Lincoln to Springfield with farm equipment that makes the whole rig handle like a boat in rough water. Every route is different and every route is exactly the same. Different cargo, different destinations, same basic process: load it, haul it, unload it, do it again.

The sameness should be boring. Instead it's comforting. I know what to expect from the highway. Can't say that about much else in life.

I'm in Omaha on a Tuesday, pulling into Tommy Brennan's dispatch office to pick up my next assignment. The office is small—just a couple rooms in a warehouse building on the industrial edge of town—but it's home base for the dozen or so drivers Tommy keeps on rotation. When I walk in, Tommy's at his desk buried under paperwork, phone tucked between his shoulder and ear, cigarette burning in the ashtray.

He sees me, holds up one finger in a "wait a minute" gesture, finishes his phone conversation. When he hangs up he leans back in his chair and gives me the look he always gives me—half father figure, half boss, all business.

"Ryan. Good timing. How'd the Springfield run go?"

"Fine. Delivered yesterday afternoon, got back this morning."

"Any problems?"

"None."

"Good man." He shuffles through the papers on his desk, finds what he's looking for. "I've got another Omaha-St. Louis for you. Same route as usual, leaves Thursday. That work?"

"Yeah, that's fine."

He hands me the paperwork and I scan it quickly. Standard load, standard delivery schedule. Nothing complicated. The way I like it.

"Oh, almost forgot." Tommy reaches into a drawer, pulls out an envelope. "This came for you. Few days ago."

I don't have to look at it to know what it is. The handwriting on the front is my mother's—neat and slanted, the way they taught her in school forty years ago. It's the fourth letter she's sent since I left home. Maybe the fifth. I've lost count because I haven't opened any of them.

"Thanks," I say, taking the envelope without looking at it.

Tommy watches me shove it in my back pocket unopened. He doesn't comment, but I can see him thinking about it. Finally he says, "Your business, kid. Just… might want to at least read them someday."

"Maybe."

We both know I won't. Tommy sighs, lights a new cigarette off the old one.

"You got a place to stay tonight?"

"Boarding house on Fifth. Same as usual."

"All right. See you Thursday morning then. Seven sharp."

I nod and turn to leave, but Tommy's voice stops me.

"Ryan."

I look back.

"You doing okay? Out there on the road, I mean. You seem… I don't know. More distant than usual."

"I'm fine. Just tired."

"If you ever want to talk—"

"I'm good, Tommy. Really."

He doesn't look convinced but he lets it drop. That's one thing I appreciate about Tommy—he cares enough to ask, but he respects the answer even when it's bullshit. A lot of bosses wouldn't.

Outside, the Omaha afternoon is overcast and threatening rain. I walk back to my truck, climb into the cab, and pull my mother's letter out of my pocket. Look at it for a long minute. The envelope is slightly bent from being in my jeans, my name written across the front in blue ink. Mrs. Thatcher's return address in the corner—she's Mrs. Thatcher now, not Mrs. Cross. That tells me everything I need to know.

I toss the letter on the passenger seat where it lands on top of the other three I haven't opened. Eventually I'll throw them all away. Or maybe I'll keep carrying them around, physical reminders of the life I left behind. Either way, I'm not reading them.

Whatever Mom has to say—apologies, explanations, invitations to come visit and pretend we're a happy family—it won't change anything. Dad's still dead. Ben's still sleeping in his bed. And I'm still out here because home stopped being home the minute she decided grief was something you could fix by replacing the person you lost.

I know that's not fair. Know she was lonely, know she deserves happiness, know Dad would probably want her to move on. But fair or not, I can't go back there. Can't sit at dinner with Ben and Mom and pretend we're something we're not. Can't see Dad's chair with someone else in it, can't walk past their bedroom and know it's "their" bedroom now instead of my parents' room.

Better to stay gone. Better for everyone.

I spend the night at the boarding house—cheap room with a narrow bed and shared bathroom down the hall—and the next day I kill time around Omaha. Get the oil changed on the truck, eat at a diner, see a Western at a movie theater that smells like old popcorn and cigarette smoke. The movie's forgettable, something about cowboys and cattle rustlers, and I walk out halfway through because I'd rather sleep.

Thursday morning I'm at Tommy's office at seven sharp, load my cargo, and hit the road.

The days blur together after that. I make the Omaha-St. Louis run, then a quick turnaround to Kansas City with machine parts. At a rest stop outside Topeka I run into Dale Cooper, a driver I've crossed paths with maybe a dozen times over the past two years.

Dale's in his mid-fifties, weathered and lean, with the permanent squint of a man who's spent thirty years staring at highways. He's been driving since before I was born, knows every truck stop and back road between here and California. If there's anyone who embodies the trucker lifestyle, it's Dale.

We end up getting coffee at the rest stop's vending machines—fifty cents for burnt coffee in a paper cup that's too hot to hold—and sitting at a picnic table in the shade while our trucks idle nearby.

"Where you headed?" Dale asks, lighting a cigarette.

"Kansas City. You?"

"Wichita. Got a load of textiles." He takes a long drag, exhales smoke. "You still running that Omaha-St. Louis route?"

"Mostly. Tommy mixes it up sometimes."

Dale nods thoughtfully. "Be careful with that."

"With what?"

"Getting too comfortable with one route. Start knowing the stops too well, start having a favorite diner or a usual parking spot. Next thing you know you're looking forward to being in specific places instead of just being on the road." He gives me a knowing look. "That's when it gets dangerous."

"Dangerous how?"

"Because you start thinking about staying. About putting down roots. And roots are the death of guys like us." He gestures with his cigarette, encompassing both of us and the trucks and the highway beyond. "The road's supposed to take you everywhere, not keep bringing you back to the same place. Minute you start wanting to go back to somewhere specific, you've lost what makes this life work."

I think about Junction City. About the fact that my route brings me through there every two weeks, about how I've started to recognize the waitress and know which parking spot I prefer. Is that what Dale's warning against?

"I'm not looking to settle down anywhere," I say.

"Good. Keep it that way." Dale finishes his coffee, crushes the cup in his fist. "I've seen too many drivers fall for some waitress or townie, try to make it work with the road between them. Never ends well. Someone always has to give up their life—either he quits driving or she follows him around, and either way it turns into resentment and heartbreak."

"Noted."

"I'm serious, kid. Best thing about this life is the freedom. Don't trade it for something as fleeting as companionship or comfort. Those things are temporary. The road is forever."

He stands, tosses his cup in the trash barrel, and heads back to his truck. I sit there a while longer, finishing my own coffee, thinking about what he said.

Dale's right. The freedom is the whole point. The minute you start needing to be in specific places, with specific people, you've given up the thing that makes the highway life work. I've seen it myself—drivers who get attached to women in truck stop towns, try to time their routes to see them, end up miserable when the logistics don't work out.

That's not going to be me. I don't need anyone. Don't need Junction City to be more than just a midpoint stop. Don't need to remember waitresses' names or have favorite booths or think about anyone I helped in a parking lot two weeks ago.

The road is enough. It has to be.

I drain the last of my coffee and head back to my truck. The Kansas afternoon is hot and still, the kind of weather that makes you grateful for forward motion and wind through the windows. I pull back onto the highway and settle into the familiar rhythm of driving.

Miles pass. Hours pass. The sun tracks across the sky and I track across the map, covering ground that will need to be covered again next week and the week after that. This is my life. This is what I chose.

And if sometimes late at night in some rest stop somewhere I wonder if there's more to life than this endless cycle of loading and hauling and unloading, I push the thought away. Because more means complications. More means attachments. More means risk.

I'm not ready for more. Not sure I'll ever be.

Two weeks after helping Nina Lawson with her car, my route brings me back toward Junction City. I don't think about it consciously—don't count the days or anticipate the stop. It's just another midpoint, just another lunch break, just another truck stop where I'll eat and fuel up and keep moving.

If I remember Nina at all, it's only in passing. Just another stranger I helped once, face already fading from memory. By the time I reach Junction City I'll have forgotten her completely.

That's what I tell myself.

That's what needs to be true.
