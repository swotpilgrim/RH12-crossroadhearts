# Chapter 10: Falling Without Meaning To

I can't stop thinking about her.

That's the problem. That's the thing that keeps me up at night in rest stops across the Midwest, staring at the ceiling of my truck cab while my mind replays moments I should've let fade.

The way Nina laughed when I told her about the escaped chickens. How she looked sitting on that courthouse bench eating ice cream, completely at home in her own skin. The sound her voice makes when she says my name. The way her face lit up when she saw me walk into the diner, like I was something worth being happy about.

The kiss. Quick and uncertain, barely more than a brush of my lips against her cheek, but I can still feel it. Can still smell the lemon scent of her hair, still see the surprised-but-pleased look in her eyes.

I drive from Omaha to Kansas City with those memories playing on repeat, and somewhere on Highway 35 in the middle of nowhere, the realization hits me like a physical blow.

I'm falling in love with Nina Lawson.

Not "might be" or "could be." Am. Present tense. Already happening. Maybe already happened and I'm just now admitting it to myself.

The thought scares me worse than anything has in two years.

I pull off at the next rest stop—one of those bare-bones places with just a parking lot and restrooms—and sit in the cab with the engine running, trying to process this. Love. I'm in love. With a seventeen-year-old girl stuck in a Kansas crossroads town, taking care of her grandmother, serving eggs to farmers at a diner.

A girl who deserves so much better than a drifter who lives out of a truck and can't even stay in one place long enough to matter.

But she does matter. God, she matters.

I built my whole life around not needing anyone. After Dad died and Mom remarried, I learned that people leave or move on, that counting on someone means setting yourself up for disappointment. Better to stay unattached. Better to keep moving. Better to make sure nobody matters enough to hurt you when they're gone.

But Nina slipped past all those defenses without me even noticing. Now she matters when I'm driving through Nebraska, thinking about what I'll tell her when I see her next. She matters when I'm eating alone at some anonymous truck stop diner, wishing she was across the table. She matters when I'm lying in this bunk at night, counting days until Junction City like a kid counting down to Christmas.

That's dangerous. That's exactly what I've spent two years avoiding.

I light a cigarette with shaking hands and smoke it while trucks rumble past on the highway. What am I supposed to do with this? I can't be in love with her. I'm twenty years old, I drive a truck for a living, I don't have a home or savings or any kind of stable future to offer. I show up in her town every two weeks and then I leave again. That's not the foundation for a relationship. That's a recipe for heartbreak.

Tommy's words echo in my head: "Truckers falling for townies never ends well. Someone has to give up their life."

He's right. He's absolutely right. If I want to be with Nina—really be with her, not just these stolen Thursday afternoons—one of us would have to change everything. Either I quit driving and find a way to stay in Junction City, or she gives up taking care of her grandmother and follows me around to truck stops and rest areas. Both options are impossible.

So the logical thing would be to end this now. Stop going to Junction City. Request a different route from Tommy. Let this connection fade before it becomes something neither of us can walk away from.

I should do that. That's the smart play. The safe play.

I flick the cigarette out the window and reach for another one. My hands won't stop shaking.

The truth is, I don't want to stop. Don't want to give up Thursdays with Nina, don't want to lose the way she makes Junction City feel less like a waypoint and more like somewhere I belong. Don't want to go back to the empty routine of driving and sleeping and driving again with nothing to look forward to except the next mile marker.

She's made everything different. Made me different.

Before Nina, I told myself I was fine with this life. The highway was freedom, perpetual motion was safety, never staying anywhere meant never getting hurt. I believed that. Needed to believe it because the alternative—admitting I was lonely, admitting I was running instead of traveling—was too painful to face.

But now I can't unsee it. Can't pretend that eating alone in diners is the same as eating with someone who actually listens when you talk. Can't pretend that sleeping in a truck cab is freedom when there's somewhere I'd rather be, someone I'd rather be with.

Nina's ruined me for this life I've been living. And I'm terrified because I don't know what comes next.

I start the engine and pull back onto the highway. I've got a delivery in Kansas City tomorrow morning, then another load to St. Louis after that. The schedule keeps moving, the miles keep accumulating, the routine continues whether I want it to or not.

But my mind's not on the route. It's on Nina. Always on Nina.

When I reach Kansas City and check into a boarding house for the night, I lie on the narrow bed and stare at the water-stained ceiling and try to imagine a different life. One where I stay in one place. Where I see Nina every day instead of every two weeks. Where I'm the kind of man who can be counted on, depended on, who doesn't run when things get complicated.

Can I be that man? The one she deserves?

I don't know. I've spent two years being the opposite—unreliable, transient, emotionally unavailable. You don't just flip a switch and become someone different. Change requires intention, requires effort, requires being vulnerable enough to try and risk failing.

But for Nina, maybe I could try. Maybe I could be braver than I've been. Maybe loving her is enough of a reason to stop running and figure out how to stay.

The thought terrifies me and thrills me in equal measure.

I don't sleep much that night. Just lie there thinking about Junction City, about Thursday afternoons in that back booth, about the way Nina's hand felt when it accidentally brushed mine while reaching for the salt. About Betty Lawson saying I have kind eyes and Nina saying she looks forward to Thursdays now.

About what it would mean to choose this—to choose her—over the safety of constant motion.

By morning I still don't have answers. But I know one thing: I can't stop seeing her. Can't walk away from the only thing that's made me feel like more than just a guy passing through. Even if I don't know how to make this work, even if the logistics are impossible, even if I'm setting myself up for heartbreak.

I'm already in too deep to back out now.

When I call Tommy for my next assignment, he asks if I want that Denver route again—the one that doesn't go through Junction City.

"No," I say. "I'm good with what I've got."

"You sure, kid? It's more money."

"I'm sure."

There's a pause, then Tommy sighs. "All right. But Ryan?"

"Yeah?"

"Whatever you're holding onto in Junction City—make sure it's worth what you're giving up for it."

I hang up and sit in the phone booth thinking about his words. What am I giving up? Better pay, sure. Maybe more opportunities. But what am I getting? Thursday afternoons with someone who makes me laugh. Someone who sees past the deflections and defenses to whoever I actually am underneath. Someone who makes me want to be better, braver, more than I've been.

Is that worth giving up the illusion of freedom I've been clinging to?

Yeah. It is.

I'm halfway in love with Nina Lawson, maybe more than halfway, and there's no backing away from that now. I can either run from it—take that Denver route, let this fade, go back to the safe solitude of the highway—or I can stay in it, see where it goes, risk getting my heart broken for the first time since Dad died.

The choice should be harder than it is. Should require more thought, more weighing of pros and cons. But when I imagine never seeing Nina again, never hearing her laugh or watching her steal my fries or listening to her talk about Junction City like it's both a cage and a home, my chest aches so badly I can barely breathe.

That's love, isn't it? When the thought of losing someone hurts worse than the fear of getting hurt.

I get back in my truck and head toward St. Louis, and for the first time in two years the highway doesn't feel like freedom. It feels like the distance between me and where I want to be.

Six days until Junction City. Six days until I see Nina again. Six days to figure out what I'm going to do about falling in love with a girl who's rooted in a place I've been trained to leave.

I don't have the answers yet. But I'm starting to think that maybe—just maybe—staying is braver than running.

And maybe it's time I tried being brave.
