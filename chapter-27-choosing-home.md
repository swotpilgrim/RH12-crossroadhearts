# Chapter 27: Choosing Home

Nina took my hand and pulled me toward the door.

"Come inside," she said. "You need to talk to Grandma."

My stomach dropped. "Nina, I—"

"She's been waiting for you."

That didn't make sense. Betty couldn't have known I was coming. I didn't know I was coming until yesterday.

But Nina was already opening the door, pulling me into the warm house that smelled like coffee and Betty's rose perfume.

Betty sat in her chair by the living room window, wrapped in a quilt despite the decent December weather. She looked frailer than four weeks ago—skin papery, hands thin on the armrests. But her eyes were sharp when she saw me standing in her doorway with flowers in my hand and Nina's tearstained face beside me.

She smiled like she'd been expecting this all along.

"Well," Betty said. "Look what the cat dragged in. Took you long enough, boy."

"Yes, ma'am." I stood there feeling like an idiot with the bouquet.

"Those for me or my granddaughter?"

"You, ma'am. If that's okay."

Betty's smile widened. "Smart boy. Come here."

I walked over, handed her the flowers. She took them, brought them to her nose, breathed in.

"Beautiful. Nina, put these in water, would you?"

Nina took the flowers, disappeared into the kitchen. I could hear her moving around, opening cabinets, running the tap.

Betty looked at me. Really looked at me.

"You planning to stay this time?" she asked.

"Yes, ma'am."

"For how long?"

"Permanently. If you'll let me."

"Let you?" Betty laughed, but it came out wheezy. "Boy, I've been watching you circle my granddaughter for months like some lovesick puppy. Figured eventually you'd get your head out of your backside and do something about it."

Despite everything, I smiled.

"I'd like your permission to court Nina properly," I said. "To make Junction City my home. To be part of her life—your life—for real."

"You asking or telling?"

"Asking, ma'am."

Betty was quiet for a moment. Studied my face like she could read everything I wasn't saying.

"You know what you're signing up for?" she asked. "Small-town girl with a dying grandmother. That's not glamorous. Not exciting. Not the open road you've been living."

"The open road wasn't living," I said. "It was hiding. Nina makes me want to actually live."

"What if I linger for years? What if Nina's stuck here caring for me while you're young and could be somewhere else?"

"Then I'll help. Be here with her. Whatever she needs."

"And if the road calls you back? If you wake up one day resenting this choice?"

That was the question, wasn't it? The one Nina had asked on the porch. The one I'd been asking myself for four weeks.

"Mrs. Lawson—"

"Betty."

"Betty." I took a breath. "Two years ago when my dad died, I started running. Told myself it was freedom, adventure, seeing the country. Really I was just scared. Scared of staying in one place long enough to hurt again. Scared of letting people matter. Scared of disappointing anyone or being disappointed."

Betty nodded like she understood.

"Meeting Nina changed that," I continued. "Made me want to stop running. Made me want to be the kind of man who stays. Who fights for what matters. Who's brave enough to build something real."

"That's a nice speech," Betty said. "But words are easy. Staying's hard."

"Yes, ma'am. I know. That's why I got off long-haul before I came here. Took a regional position out of Kansas City—shorter routes, home every few days. I wanted to have a real plan, not just promises."

"Tell me about this plan."

Nina came back from the kitchen, sat on the arm of Betty's chair. Betty reached up, took her hand.

I explained the regional route. The Kansas City base, two hundred mile radius, Junction City right in the middle of my coverage area. Home every three days instead of every two weeks. Eventually save enough to buy my own rig, run local routes exclusively out of Junction City.

"I'll find an apartment here," I said. "Build a real life. Be around to help with Betty, fix things around the house, whatever you need. This isn't me passing through anymore. It's me staying."

Nina was crying again. Happy crying, I thought. Hoped.

Betty was quiet for a long moment.

Then she said, "Permission granted. About damn time."

Relief hit me so hard my knees went weak.

"Thank you," I said.

"Don't thank me yet. You hurt my granddaughter and Sheriff Hayes will find your body in a ditch." Betty said it sweet, but her eyes were serious. "Understood?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Good." Betty settled back in her chair. "Now somebody make me lunch. All this romance is exhausting."

Nina laughed, stood up, kissed her grandmother's cheek. Then she came to me, wrapped her arms around my waist, looked up at me like she couldn't quite believe this was real.

"You're really staying," she whispered.

"I'm really staying."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

We made lunch together in Betty's small kitchen. Domestic, ordinary, perfect. The kind of thing I'd never let myself want because wanting it meant risking losing it.

But not risking anything meant not having anything worth keeping.

And Nina was worth every risk.

We were just sitting down to eat when someone knocked on the door.

Sheriff Hayes stood on the porch in his uniform, hat in hand.

"Afternoon, Nina. Betty." He nodded to them, then turned to me. "Mr. Cross."

"Sheriff."

"Heard you were in town."

Of course he had. Small-town grapevine worked faster than telegraph.

"Yes, sir."

"Mind stepping outside for a minute?"

Nina looked worried, but I squeezed her hand. "It's okay."

I followed Hayes onto the porch. He closed the door behind us.

"You planning to stick around Junction City?" he asked.

"Yes, sir. Got a regional route out of Kansas City. I'll be here every few days."

"For how long?"

"Permanently."

Hayes studied me. He was maybe forty-five, built like he'd been a boxer once, eyes that didn't miss much.

"What are your intentions with Nina Lawson?"

The question was so formal, so old-fashioned, it almost made me smile.

"To court her properly. Marry her eventually, if she'll have me. Build a life here."

"You love her?"

"Yes, sir."

"She know that?"

"I told her."

Hayes nodded slowly. "Nina's a good girl. Lost too much already—parents moved away, stuck here caring for Betty. Town looks out for her."

"I understand."

"Do you?" Hayes stepped closer. "Because if you're just passing through, if you're going to break her heart and disappear back onto the highway, better you leave now. She doesn't need more disappointment."

"I'm not leaving," I said. Firm, certain. "I spent two years on the road running from anything that mattered. Nina made me want to stop running. I'm here to stay, Sheriff. For real."

Hayes looked at me for a long moment.

Then he held out his hand.

"Welcome to Junction City, son."

I shook his hand, relief flooding through me.

"Thank you, sir."

"Call me Hayes. Everyone does." He put his hat back on. "You need help finding an apartment, talk to Mrs. Patterson at the boarding house. She knows every rental in town."

"I will. Thank you."

Hayes nodded, walked down the porch steps, got in his patrol car. I watched him drive away and realized I'd just been given official approval by Junction City law enforcement.

I'd been accepted.

When I came back inside, Nina was grinning.

"What did he say?"

"Welcomed me to town. Asked my intentions."

"And what did you tell him?"

"That I'm here to stay. That I love you. That I plan to marry you someday if you'll have me."

Nina's eyes went wide. "You told Sheriff Hayes you wanted to marry me before you told me?"

Oh. Probably should've thought that through.

"I—well—I meant eventually, not right now, just that I—"

Nina laughed, kissed me. "Relax. I'm teasing."

"So you're not mad?"

"About you wanting to marry me someday? No, Ryan. I'm not mad."

She kissed me again and my heart settled.

By evening, half of Junction City knew the trucker was staying for Nina Lawson.

Judy showed up around six with a casserole and a knowing smile. "Heard you're sticking around."

"News travels fast."

"Small town, honey. Everyone knows everything." She handed Nina the casserole. "Welcome home, Ryan."

The phone rang twice while we ate—neighbors calling to congratulate Nina, to ask if it was true, to invite us to Sunday dinner.

Mrs. Patterson from the boarding house stopped by to tell me she had a room available if I needed temporary housing while I looked for an apartment.

The mechanic from the truck stop drove past, honked, waved.

It was overwhelming and embarrassing and wonderful.

This was what community felt like. What belonging felt like.

What home felt like.

After Betty went to bed, Nina and I sat on the porch swing in our coats, watching Junction City settle in for the night.

"Still scared?" she asked.

"Terrified."

"Me too."

"But good terrified?"

"Yeah." Nina leaned against me. "Good terrified."

We rocked gently, her hand in mine, Junction City quiet around us.

Two years ago I'd have called this a cage. Small town, regular schedule, people knowing my business, expectations and routines and roots going down deep.

But sitting here with Nina, I didn't feel trapped.

I felt like I'd finally stopped running long enough to find what I'd been looking for all along.

"Thank you," Nina said quietly.

"For what?"

"For coming back. For choosing this. For being brave enough to stay."

"You're the brave one. I just finally caught up."

She smiled against my shoulder.

The highway was still out there—Highway 40 running east and west through Junction City, the Crossroads where people passed through on their way to somewhere else.

But I wasn't passing through anymore.

I was home.

And home wasn't the place you came from. It was the place you chose to build. The person you chose to build it with.

I chose Nina. Chose Junction City. Chose the terrifying, beautiful risk of letting myself belong somewhere.

The bravest thing I'd ever done wasn't the miles I'd driven.

It was stopping.

It was staying.

It was choosing home.
