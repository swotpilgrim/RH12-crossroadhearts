# Chapter 25: Finding Her

"Ryan?"

"Hey."

"What are you doing here?"

"I came to talk. If that's okay."

Nina's expression shifted—surprise, confusion, hurt, hope. Settled on guarded.

"It's six in the morning."

"I know. I couldn't wait."

"Can I come in?"

Nina hesitated, looked back inside. "Not inside. Grandma's having a good morning." She stepped onto the porch, crossed her arms. "Say what you came to say."

Fair enough.

I took a breath. Let it out. Tried to find words for everything churning in my chest.

"Four weeks ago when you said you couldn't do the goodbye cycle anymore, I thought you were asking me to leave. I thought I was doing what you wanted by staying away. But I was wrong. You weren't asking me to leave—you were asking me to stay."

Nina's eyes filled with tears. She blinked them back.

"And I didn't," I continued. "I walked away because I was scared. Scared of disappointing you, scared of not being enough, scared of building something real and watching it fall apart. I've been running for two years, Nina. From my father's death, from my mother moving on too fast, from anything that felt like commitment. The road was safe. Easy. Uncomplicated."

"And I was complicated," Nina said quietly.

"No. You were real. You were everything I wanted and everything I was terrified of wanting." I stepped closer. "I spent the past four weeks trying to convince myself that staying away was better. That giving you a clean break was the right thing. Know what I figured out?"

"What?"

"I was miserable. More miserable than I've been in two years. Because avoiding you didn't protect me from pain—it guaranteed it. Every mile I drove, every town that wasn't Junction City, every morning I woke up knowing you were here and I was somewhere else—it killed me."

A tear slid down Nina's cheek. She didn't wipe it away.

"I saw my future," I said. "Met a guy—Dale Cooper, long-haul driver, been on the road for thirty years. No wife, no kids, no home. Just truck stops and highway miles and regrets about the woman he didn't choose. That's what I was becoming, Nina. And I couldn't do it. Couldn't become him. Couldn't live with the regret of letting you go without fighting."

"So what are you saying?" Nina's voice was barely a whisper.

"I'm saying I made changes. Real ones, not just promises." I pulled out the card Mike Harrison had given me, handed it to her. "I got off long-haul. Took a regional position with a company out of Kansas City. Shorter runs, home every few days. I'll be in Junction City as part of my regular route."

Nina stared at the card. "You quit long-haul?"

"Yeah. Yesterday was my last run."

"Ryan, that's—the road is everything to you."

"No." I said it firm. Certain. "You're everything to me. The road was just what I was hiding in."

Nina looked up, tears streaming now. "You really quit?"

"I got an apartment too. Kansas City, near the regional office. Six-month lease. It's small, barely has furniture yet, but it's mine. First permanent address I've had in two years." I took her hand. Cold fingers, shaking. "I'm not passing through anymore, Nina. I'm staying. Building a life. And I want—God, I want you to be part of it. If you'll have me. If I didn't mess this up too badly."

"Ryan—"

"I know I hurt you. I know walking away was the wrong move. I know four weeks is a long time and you might've moved on or decided you're better off without me." The words tumbled out, desperate. "But I had to try. Had to come here and tell you I love you and I'm sorry and I'm not running anymore. I'm all in, Nina. Completely. Terrifyingly. If you'll give me another chance."

Nina was crying openly now, and I couldn't tell if it was good crying or bad crying and it was killing me.

"Say something," I said. "Please."

"You quit long-haul," she repeated, like she couldn't quite believe it.

"Yeah."

"For me?"

"For us. For a life that's more than just highway miles and goodbye." I squeezed her hand. "I don't know if I'll be good at staying. Don't know if I'll mess this up. But I want to try, Nina. Want to be the kind of man who deserves you. Want to build something real instead of just passing through."

Nina pulled her hand free. My heart dropped.

Then she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around me, burying her face in my chest.

"You idiot," she said into my jacket. "You complete idiot."

I held her, hardly daring to breathe. "Is that a good idiot or a bad idiot?"

"Both." Nina pulled back enough to look at me, face wet with tears. "You really think I moved on in four weeks?"

"I didn't know. Hoped you hadn't."

"I tried." She laughed, but it came out choked. "God, I tried. Told myself you were right to walk away, that we were impossible, that I should just focus on Betty and forget about you. Know how well that worked?"

"How well?"

"Not at all. Every Tuesday I kept looking for your truck. Every time the phone rang I hoped it was you. Every night I lay awake wondering if I'd made a mistake, if I should've fought harder, if you were thinking about me too."

Relief hit me so hard my knees almost buckled.

"I thought about you constantly," I said. "Every single day. Every mile. You were all I could think about."

"Then why'd you stay away so long?"

"Because I needed to make real changes first. Needed to prove to myself I could do this—could get off the road, could build roots, could be what you need. Didn't want to show up empty-handed with just apologies." I cupped her face in my hands. "I'm here now. With an actual plan, an actual life. I'm staying, Nina. For real."

She stared at me for a long moment. Then she kissed me.

When we broke apart, Nina rested her forehead against mine.

"Don't leave again," she whispered. "Don't run."

"I'm staying."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Inside, Betty called for Nina.

"I should go. Grandma needs breakfast."

"I'll help."

"You don't have to—"

"I want to. I'm part of this now."

Nina smiled. "Okay."

We went inside.

Betty was in the living room, sitting in her chair by the window, wrapped in a quilt. She looked frailer than four weeks ago, skin papery thin, but her eyes were sharp when she saw me.

"Well, well." Betty's voice was strong despite her appearance. "Look what the cat dragged in. Took you long enough, boy."

"Yes, ma'am." I stood there awkwardly, not sure what to say.

"Grandma Betty, Ryan came to—" Nina started.

"I know what he came to do." Betty waved her hand. "I'm old, not blind. Saw the way you two looked at each other months ago. Been wondering when this boy would get his head out of his backside and do something about it."

Despite everything, I had to smile.

"I'm sorry it took so long," I said. "I was—"

"Scared." Betty said it matter-of-fact. "Young people always are. Think they're the first ones to ever be afraid of loving someone, of staying put, of building a life. News flash, son—everyone's scared. Difference is whether you let it win."

"Yes, ma'am."

"You done letting it win?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Good." Betty looked at Nina. "He staying for breakfast?"

Nina looked at me, question in her eyes.

"If that's okay," I said.

"More than okay." Nina's smile could've lit up the whole room.

I helped Nina in the kitchen. Domestic, ordinary, right. We brought Betty her breakfast, then sat at the table.

"Tell me about the regional position."

"Two hundred mile radius. Kansas City to Topeka, Wichita, Salina. Back every three days. Junction City's in the middle."

"So you'd be here often."

"Every few days instead of every two weeks." I took her hand. "This is real. Not passing through. We can have actual dates, build something."

"What about Betty? She's getting weaker. I'm still stuck here—"

"Then I'll help." Simple, certain. "I'll be in Junction City anyway. Fix things, sit with Betty when you need a break, doctor appointments. Whatever you need."

Nina's eyes filled. "You mean that."

"Yeah."

She got up, sat in my lap, kissed me. I held her tight.

From the living room: "You two better not be doing anything inappropriate!"

Nina laughed. "We're not, Grandma!"

"Better not be!"

We finished breakfast, cleaned up together. Part of me kept waiting for the fear to kick in, for the urge to run.

But it didn't. Being here felt right.

"When do you start?" Nina asked, drying plates.

"Monday."

"And you'll be back..."

"Thursday, probably. I'll make sure Junction City's on my schedule." I handed her a plate. "I'll call every night. Get a phone in my apartment."

"Look at you, all permanent."

"Terrifying, right?"

"Good terrifying."

We finished dishes. Got Betty settled for a nap. Sat on the porch swing in our coats.

"What are you thinking?" Nina asked.

"That this is the first time in two years I've felt like I'm where I'm supposed to be."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." I wrapped my arm around her. "I spent two years running. But I was wrong. This is what I was looking for."

Nina was quiet. "I'm scared too."

"Of what?"

"That you'll change your mind. That staying will feel like a cage."

I made her look at me. "That's not going to happen."

"How do you know?"

"Because the road wasn't my life—it was where I was hiding from having one. You're giving me everything I didn't know I needed."

She kissed me.

"I believe you," she said.

We sat on the porch swing until the sun was high, making plans and talking about the future—a real future, one that didn't involve goodbye every two weeks, one that had weekends and holidays and ordinary moments strung together like a life instead of just stolen hours between departures.

For the first time in two years, I wasn't thinking about the next mile marker, the next town, the next place to run to.

I wasn't counting miles until the next departure.

I was home.
