# Chapter 17: Fear Sets In

Three days.

I'd been back in Omaha for three days, and I still couldn't shake the feeling of Nina's hand on my jaw, the taste of Coca-Cola on her lips, the way she'd whispered _I'm falling for you_ like it was a confession and a question all at once.

I was in love with her. Completely, terrifyingly in love.

And I had no idea what the hell to do about it.

The Omaha yard was busy—trucks coming and going, drivers grabbing manifests. Tommy's office sat in the corner of the warehouse, windows overlooking the loading docks. I'd been avoiding him, picking up assignments from the dispatcher and getting out before he could corner me.

But I couldn't avoid him forever. This was day three, and Tommy was getting that look—the one that said he knew something was up and was done waiting.

I was sitting in the cab of my Peterbilt, engine off, smoking a Camel and staring at nothing when Tommy knocked on the door.

"You planning to sit here all day, or you got a route to run?"

I looked down at him through the window. Tommy was mid-forties, going soft around the middle, with the kind of face that had seen every trick a driver could throw at him. He'd run this operation for ten years, drove long-haul before that. He knew when one of his drivers was carrying something heavier than cargo.

"Got a route," I said. "Kansas City to Des Moines. Heading out in an hour."

"Kansas City." Tommy nodded slowly. "That go through Junction City?"

My chest tightened. "Could. Depends on the route I take."

"Uh-huh." Tommy leaned against the truck, arms crossed. "You gonna tell me what's eating you, or do I gotta guess?"

"Nothing's eating me."

"Ryan." His voice was patient but firm. "I've been doing this long enough to know when a driver's got woman trouble. You've had that look since you got back from your last run."

I took a drag off the cigarette, let the smoke burn down into my lungs before I answered. "It's complicated."

"It usually is." Tommy waited, giving me space to either talk or shut him down. When I didn't say anything, he sighed. "Look, kid. You're a good driver. Reliable, don't cause trouble, show up when you say you will. But you've been different lately. Requesting Junction City routes, timing your stops, asking about regional runs. I'm not blind."

"I haven't asked about regional runs."

"Not yet." Tommy's eyes were knowing. "But you're thinking about it. Aren't you?"

I stubbed out the cigarette on the sole of my boot, didn't answer.

"There's a girl," Tommy said. It wasn't a question.

"Yeah." The admission came out rough. "There's a girl."

"In Junction City."

"Yeah."

Tommy was quiet for a minute, and I could see him thinking through the math—the logistics of a long-haul driver falling for a small-town girl, the impossibility of making that work with weeks on the road and two-year leases on routes that covered half the country.

"What's her name?" he asked finally.

"Nina."

"She worth it?"

The question hit me harder than it should have. Was Nina worth giving up the road? Worth risking the safe, uncomplicated life I'd built in two years of running? Worth the fear of staying in one place, of letting someone need me, of failing the way I'd failed my mother when my father died?

"Yeah," I said, and my voice came out certain despite everything churning in my gut. "She's worth it."

"Then what's the problem?"

I laughed, but it came out bitter. "The problem is I don't know how to be what she needs. I've been running for two years, Tommy. Living out of this cab, never staying anywhere longer than a night. Nina's rooted in Junction City taking care of her grandmother. She can't leave. And I—" I stopped, swallowed. "I don't know if I can stay."

"Can't or won't?"

"What's the difference?"

"Big one." Tommy shifted his weight, still leaning against the truck. "Can't means it's impossible. Won't means you're scared."

I didn't answer, because he was right and we both knew it.

"Let me tell you something," Tommy said. "I drove long-haul for fifteen years. Omaha to Los Angeles, Omaha to Houston, Omaha to Portland. Saw the whole country from the cab of a truck. Met my wife Ellen at a diner in Lincoln—she was waitressing, I was passing through. We dated for two years with me on the road, and it was hell. Saying goodbye every week, wondering if she'd get tired of waiting, scared to death she'd realize she deserved better than some trucker who was never around."

I looked at him, surprised. Tommy never talked about his personal life, never shared more than surface-level small talk.

"What'd you do?" I asked.

"I got off the road." Tommy shrugged like it was simple. "Found a dispatcher job here in Omaha, married Ellen, had three kids. Been here ten years now. You know what I miss about long-haul?"

"What?"

"Not a damn thing." He said it with complete certainty. "The road's good for what it is—freedom, independence, nobody to answer to. But it's lonely as hell, Ryan. And it doesn't keep you warm at night."

"I'm not you."

"No, you're not." Tommy pushed off the truck, started to walk away, then turned back. "But you're running from something, same as I was. Difference is, I figured out what I was running _to_ mattered more than what I was running _from_. You figure that out, you let me know. Regional run's still available if you want it."

He walked back toward the office, and I sat in the cab feeling like I'd been hit by a truck.

Tommy was right. I was running. Had been running since the day I left home at eighteen, my father six months dead and my mother already remarried to a man who wanted to be my friend, my father, my _replacement_. I couldn't do it—couldn't sit at that dinner table and pretend everything was fine, couldn't watch my mother laugh with someone else, couldn't be what they needed me to be.

So I ran. Got my commercial license, found Tommy's outfit, started driving. Told myself it was freedom, that the road was where I belonged, that staying in one place would suffocate me.

But that was a lie. The road wasn't freedom—it was fear. Fear of being needed and failing. Fear of letting people down the way I'd let my mother down by not being able to just _accept_ her new husband and move on. Fear of the pain that came with attachment, with caring about people who could leave or die or replace you.

The truck cab smelled like diesel and old coffee and the ghost of cigarette smoke. It had been home for two years. The only home I'd let myself have.

And now Nina was asking me—not in words, but in the way she'd looked at me in the rain, in the way she'd whispered _I'm falling for you_—to choose something different. To choose her. To choose Junction City and permanence and all the terrifying vulnerability that came with staying.

I didn't know if I could do it.

Didn't know if I had it in me to be the kind of man who deserved her. Nina was good—genuinely, purely good. She took care of her grandmother when her parents wanted her to stick Betty in a home and come to California. She worked at the diner serving breakfast to farmers and truckers with a smile even when she was tired. She saw the best in people, believed in them even when they didn't believe in themselves.

She believed in me. Saw past the leather jacket and the cigarettes and the walls I kept up. Saw something worth falling for.

But what if she was wrong? What if I stayed and turned out to be exactly what I was afraid of—inadequate, disappointing, not enough? My father died and I couldn't fill the gap he left. My mother needed someone to help her move forward and I couldn't do it, couldn't stop grieving long enough to be what she needed. What made me think I'd be any different with Nina?

I lit another cigarette, my hands shaking.

My next route took me through Junction City in five days. Tuesday, usual time, usual stop. Nina would be at the truck stop waiting, probably sitting in our booth with a Coke and fries, looking up when I walked in with that smile that made my chest ache.

And I'd have to look her in the eye knowing I was in love with her but had no idea how to make this work. Knowing she deserved promises I didn't know how to keep. Knowing every time I drove away from Junction City it hurt worse than the time before.

The smart thing would be to end it now. Request a different route, stop torturing both of us with something that couldn't work. Nina would understand—she'd said it herself in the truck cab, _you're always leaving and I'm always staying and this can't work_. She knew the logistics as well as I did.

But the thought of not seeing her again, of Junction City becoming just another town I passed through instead of the place I counted down miles to reach—that thought made it hard to breathe.

I was caught. Stuck between wanting Nina and being terrified of wanting her, between the safety of the road and the risk of home, between running and staying.

And I didn't know which would hurt less.

A horn honked across the yard. Another driver pulling out, heading west on I-80, probably going all the way to Wyoming or Utah or California. I watched the truck disappear through the gates and felt the familiar pull—the urge to just go, to keep moving, to outrun the fear and the wanting and the terrible, wonderful feeling of loving someone enough to hurt.

Five days until Junction City. Five days to figure out what the hell I was going to say to Nina when I saw her again.

Five days to decide if I was brave enough to stay, or if I was just going to keep running until there was nothing left to run from.

I started the engine. The Peterbilt rumbled to life, familiar and solid and safe. In an hour I'd be on the road to Kansas City, and then Des Moines, and then wherever Tommy sent me next. Miles and miles of highway stretching out ahead, endless and uncomplicated.

But it didn't feel like freedom anymore.

It just felt like running.

And I was so damn tired of running.
