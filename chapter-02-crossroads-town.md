# Chapter 2: Crossroads Town

The thing about Junction City is that it exists because of the highway, not in spite of it.

Junction City was born from the crossroads—Highway 40 running east-west, Highway 77 cutting north-south, the two roads meeting in the middle of nowhere in particular. The town grew up around that intersection. Everything here exists to serve the people passing through.

The Crossroads Truck Stop sits at the literal crossing point, where the highways form a big X through the Kansas prairie. From my seat at the counter I can see both roads through the diner windows—40 stretching toward the sunset in the west, 77 disappearing into darkness heading north. Cars and trucks pass intermittently, headlights cutting through the dusk. Going somewhere. Coming from somewhere else. Nobody staying.

That's Junction City in a nutshell. A place people pass through on their way to places that matter more.

I eat slowly, making the meatloaf last, in no particular hurry. The coffee's hot and strong and the waitress keeps my cup filled without me having to ask. I've been stopping here every two weeks for a year now, long enough that she recognizes me, knows my order, but not long enough that she knows my name. Probably thinks of me as "the meatloaf guy" or "that trucker who tips decent." That's fine. That's exactly the level of recognition I want—enough to get good service, not enough to matter.

The diner's maybe half full tonight. Three other truckers scattered at the counter and booths, men in their thirties and forties with weathered faces and the permanent slouch that comes from too many hours behind the wheel. We don't acknowledge each other beyond brief nods. Truckers are friendly enough at rest stops and loading docks, but in diners there's an unspoken agreement to leave each other alone. We're all here for the same thing—food, coffee, a break from the road—and we'll all be gone soon enough. No point in getting social.

A couple farmers sit at a booth by the window, still in work clothes. An old-timer at the far end of the counter reads a newspaper, killing time. A woman with two young kids occupies another booth, the kids coloring while she stares out the window looking tired.

Everyone here is separate. Occupying the same space but living in different worlds that just happen to overlap for an hour or two. That's what I like about places like this. You can be around people without having to be with them. Present but unattached.

The jukebox switches to Buddy Holly, "Peggy Sue" tinny over the clatter of dishes. One of the farmers drops quarters in as he leaves. Same songs everyone plays—Buddy Holly, Elvis, Hank Williams. The soundtrack of every truck stop.

I finish the last of my coffee and wave off the waitress when she comes by with the pot again. She tears my check off her pad, leaves it face-down by my elbow, moves on to the next customer. I pull out my wallet—brown leather worn soft from two years in my back pocket—and leave enough bills to cover the meal plus a decent tip. Not generous enough to be memorable, just fair. That's the balance I'm always trying to strike: present enough to function, unmemorable enough to disappear.

The cowbell clangs when I push back through the door into the parking lot. Full dark now, maybe eight-thirty, the temperature dropping from the daytime heat into something almost comfortable. The neon CROSSROADS sign bathes everything in red light, and the smaller signs for the gas station and garage glow blue and white. Beyond the reach of the lights, stars are starting to show in the black Kansas sky.

I light a cigarette and walk the lot slowly, boots crunching on gravel. Maybe a dozen big rigs parked—Peterbilts, Kenworths, a couple Macks. The idling diesels create a low rumble that's almost soothing. The smell of diesel hangs in the warm air, mixing with cigarette smoke.

This is the world I live in now. Truck stops and highways, diners and parking lots, the constant low-level noise of engines and road traffic. Some people might find it lonely. I find it comforting. There's a rhythm to it, a predictability. The road looks the same everywhere you go. Diners serve the same food. Truck stops have the same layout. You always know what to expect, and expectations are kept simple.

My Peterbilt sits where I left it, third row back, wedged between two other rigs. I walk around it one more time, checking cargo straps by feel in the dim light, making sure nothing's shifted or loosened during the drive. Everything's secure. The truck's been good to me, this '54 cab-over. Not the newest model, not the fanciest, but reliable. Starts every morning, runs steady, hauls what I tell it to haul. That's all I need.

I climb into the cab, pull the door shut, and the world outside gets quieter. Not silent—I can still hear the idling trucks, distant highway traffic, the occasional car door slamming—but muffled. This is my space. Ten feet of metal and vinyl and diesel smell that belongs to me.

The cab's sparse. Driver's seat with springs that know the shape of me after two years. Steering wheel wrapped in cracked leather. Dashboard with its basic gauges and the dispatch radio mounted below. Behind the seats there's just enough room for a narrow bunk, a duffel bag of clothes, and a cardboard box with the essentials—spare carton of Camels, road atlas, flashlight, a paperback Western I'm halfway through and probably won't finish. That's it. Everything I own fits in a truck cab.

Some people would call that depressing. I call it freedom.

I pull off my boots without unlacing them, stretch out on the bunk with my head on the rolled-up denim jacket I use as a pillow. The sleeping bag's already spread out from last time I was here—I just leave it, no point in putting it away when I'll need it again in two weeks. Above me, the cab's metal roof ticks softly as it cools from the day's heat.

Through the windshield I can see the red glow of the CROSSROADS sign, the dark shapes of other trucks, the occasional sweep of headlights as a car pulls into the lot. In six hours I'll wake up, fuel up, and be back on Highway 40 heading east to St. Louis. After the delivery I'll head back to Omaha for the next load. Then another run, another highway, another truck stop.

In two weeks my route will bring me back through Junction City, same time, same routine. I'll park in this same lot, eat at that same counter, sleep in this same bunk. The waitress will pour my coffee without asking, I'll order the meatloaf, and everything will be exactly as it was tonight. Predictable. Temporary. Safe.

That's the beauty of this life—nothing changes, but nothing sticks either. Every town is new because I never stay long enough for it to become familiar. Every face is a stranger's because I never stick around for names to matter. The road keeps me moving, and motion keeps me free from all the complications that come with standing still.

I don't think about home. Don't think about Mom and Ben, or what my life might have looked like if Dad hadn't died, if I'd stayed.

No point in any of that. This is my life now. The highway, the truck, the endless cycle of loading and hauling and unloading and doing it all again. It's not what I planned when I was seventeen and thought I had all the time in the world to figure things out. But it's what I've got, and it works.

A trucker walks past my rig heading toward the diner. Someone else's engine starts up, pulls out heading north on 77. I'm separate from all of it, just another driver in another truck, indistinguishable from a hundred other guys doing the same thing tonight.

Indistinguishable. Unmemorable. Free.

I close my eyes and listen to the ambient sound of the truck stop at night—idling engines, distant highway, the hum of the diner's neon signs. It's the same sound in every truck stop, every night, every two weeks. Familiar enough to be comforting, temporary enough to require nothing from me.

Tomorrow I'll be gone and Junction City will forget I was ever here. And in two weeks I'll be back and it'll be exactly the same, like I never left, like time doesn't pass here the way it does in places where people stay and build lives and remember things that matter.

The thought should bother me, maybe. The endless repetition, the going-nowhere quality of it all. But it doesn't. It's exactly what I signed up for when I left home with a duffel bag and a commercial license. This life requires nothing from me except the ability to drive and the willingness to keep moving. No emotional investment, no attachments, no risk of being the person someone's depending on and failing them when it counts.

I'm good at driving. I'm good at moving. And I'm good at not needing anything more than a tank of gas and a road that goes somewhere else.

That's enough.

It has to be enough.

I pull the scratchy wool blanket up to my shoulder and let the sound of idling trucks lull me toward sleep. Somewhere out on Highway 40, another trucker is heading this direction, doing exactly what I'm doing—running from something or toward something or just running because motion feels safer than stillness.

We'll never meet. Never know each other's names or stories. But we're brothers in the only way that matters out here—we keep moving, we don't look back, and we don't let anything or anyone slow us down long enough to make us want to stay.

The highway doesn't judge. Doesn't ask questions. Doesn't expect anything except that you keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road ahead.

That's all I'm capable of giving right now.

And tomorrow, when dawn breaks over Kansas and Highway 40 stretches east toward another delivery in another city I'll barely see, that'll still be enough.

It has to be.
