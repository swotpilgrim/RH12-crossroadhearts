# Chapter 26: Her Fears

The sun was higher now, warming the December air enough that we didn't need to stay bundled in our coats. Nina sat beside me on the porch swing, my arm around her shoulders, and for a while we just sat in comfortable silence.

But I could feel the tension in her body. The way she kept tensing, like she wanted to say something but was holding back.

"What is it?" I asked finally.

"What?"

"You're thinking too hard. I can practically hear the gears turning."

Nina was quiet for a moment. Then she pulled away slightly, turned to look at me.

"I'm scared," she said.

"Of what?"

"Of this. Of us. Of what you're giving up." She gestured vaguely. "Ryan, you quit long-haul for me. That's huge. That's your whole life."

"It was my whole life," I corrected. "Past tense. And I didn't quit it for you—I quit it for us. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"Yeah." I took her hand. "If I quit for you, that would mean I'm sacrificing something I want because you asked me to. That I'm giving something up and might resent you for it later. But I didn't. I quit because I wanted a different life. Because I finally figured out what I actually want, and it's not endless highway miles. It's this. You."

Nina's eyes were troubled. "But what if you're wrong? What if six months from now you wake up and realize you hate regional routes, hate being settled, hate Junction City? What if you start to resent me for being the reason you gave up the road?"

"That's not going to happen."

"You can't know that."

She was right. I couldn't know for certain how I'd feel six months from now, a year from now. Couldn't guarantee I wouldn't wake up one morning missing the freedom of long-haul, missing the endless horizon.

But I could know how I felt right now. And right now, sitting on this porch with Nina, I felt more at peace than I had in two years.

"You're right," I said. "I can't know for certain. But Nina, I spent two years running. Two years on the road, telling myself it was freedom, that I was choosing adventure. Know what I figured out?"

"What?"

"It wasn't freedom. It was fear. Fear of staying in one place, fear of letting people matter, fear of building something that could break." I shifted on the swing to face her fully. "The road wasn't making me happy. It was just keeping me safe from being unhappy. There's a difference."

"I don't want to be the reason you give up who you are."

"You're not. You're the reason I'm finally becoming who I want to be." I cupped her face, made her look at me. "Two years ago when my dad died and my mom remarried too fast, I felt lost. Felt like I didn't belong anywhere. So I started driving, and the motion made me feel like I was going somewhere even when I had no destination. But I was just... drifting. Existing but not living."

Nina's eyes were wet.

"You make me want to live," I said. "Really live. Not just move from one town to the next, one meal to the next, one lonely night to the next. You make me want to build something. Have a home. Be part of something bigger than just me and my truck cab."

"But what if Junction City starts to feel like a cage? What if you look around one day and realize you're stuck here because of me?"

"Then we'll deal with it together." I said it simple, certain. "Nina, I'm not asking you to make this perfect. I'm not expecting you to somehow make settling down easy or painless. I know there'll be days I miss the road. Days I get restless. Days I wonder what I gave up."

"That's what I'm afraid of."

"But you know what I'll miss more if I keep driving?" I waited until she looked at me. "You. This. Us. The road isn't going to keep me warm at night. The road isn't going to care if I'm happy or sad or scared. The road isn't going to make me laugh or challenge me to be better or see through all my walls to the person underneath."

"Ryan—"

"I love you, Nina." The words came out easy, natural. "I'm in love with you. And yeah, I'm scared too. Scared I'll mess this up, scared I won't be good enough at staying, scared I'll disappoint you. But I'm more scared of not trying. More scared of looking back in thirty years and regretting that I let you go."

Nina started crying. I pulled her close, let her tuck her face against my shoulder.

"What if I'm not worth it?" she whispered.

"What?"

"What if you give up everything for me and I'm not worth it? What if I'm just... ordinary? What if six months from now you realize you traded your freedom for a girl who serves coffee and takes care of her dying grandmother in a nowhere Kansas town?"

That broke my heart. The idea that Nina thought of herself that way—ordinary, not worth it.

"Nina." I made her look at me. "You're not ordinary. You're the girl who chose loyalty over an easy way out. Who takes care of her grandmother even though her parents are pressuring her to put Betty in a home. Who believed in a screwed-up trucker with commitment issues when she had no reason to."

"That doesn't make me special."

"It does to me." I brushed tears off her cheeks. "You want to know what I see when I look at you?"

"What?"

"I see someone brave. Someone who does the hard thing because it's the right thing. Someone who makes a nothing town in Kansas feel like home." I kissed her forehead. "You're not ordinary, Nina. You're everything."

She was really crying now, full sobs that shook her whole body. I just held her and let her get it out—all the fear, all the doubt, all the weight she'd been carrying.

"I don't want you to regret this," she said finally, voice muffled against my chest.

"I won't."

"You can't promise that."

"You're right. I can't promise I won't ever have doubts or regrets or hard days. But I can promise I'll work through them. That I won't run when things get tough. That I'll choose you, choose us, choose this life we're building." I tipped her chin up. "That's what commitment means, right? Not the absence of fear or doubt, but the choice to stay anyway."

Nina stared at me for a long moment. Then she said, "When did you get so wise?"

"About five minutes ago. I'm winging it."

She laughed, and just like that the tension broke. She was still scared—I could see it in her eyes—but some of the weight had lifted.

"I'm going to hold you to that," she said. "The staying when things get tough part."

"Good. You should."

We sat on the swing, rocking gently back and forth. Inside, I could hear Betty moving around, probably getting ready to come check on us and make sure we weren't doing anything "inappropriate."

"Tell me about your apartment," Nina said. "What's it like?"

"Small. One bedroom, tiny kitchen, bathroom that's seen better days. But it's got windows that get good light, and it's mine."

"What's it near?"

"The regional office is about ten minutes away. There's a diner down the street that looks decent. Grocery store two blocks over." I thought about the empty rooms, the bare walls. "It needs furniture. And curtains. And pretty much everything, actually. I've got a duffel bag of clothes and not much else."

Nina smiled. "I could help with that. If you want."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. I'm good at making places feel like home." She paused. "And I'd like to see where you're living. See your place."

The thought of Nina in my apartment, helping me pick out furniture and hang curtains and turn bare walls into something that felt like mine—it made my chest tight in a good way.

"I'd like that," I said. "Maybe next week? When I'm back in town?"

"When do you start the regional position?"

"Monday."

"And when will you be back in Junction City?"

"Thursday, if I time my routes right. Maybe Friday." I squeezed her hand. "And then every few days after that. This won't be like before, Nina. It won't be two weeks of waiting and wondering. It'll be regular. Predictable. Normal."

"Normal." She tested the word. "I like the sound of that."

"Me too."

Betty's voice called from inside: "You two planning to sit on that porch all day, or is someone going to make me lunch?"

Nina rolled her eyes. "We should go in. Grandma gets cranky when she's hungry."

"Like someone else I know."

"I do not get cranky when I'm hungry."

"You absolutely do. Remember that time at the truck stop when they ran out of fries?"

"That was different. Everyone gets cranky when they run out of fries."

I laughed, stood up, pulled Nina to her feet. She wrapped her arms around my waist, looked up at me.

"Thank you," she said.

"For what?"

"For coming back. For fighting for this. For being brave enough to stay." She kissed me, soft and sweet. "I know it's not easy."

"Neither is taking care of your grandmother when your parents want you in California. Neither is staying in Junction City when you could be starting fresh somewhere else. You're brave too, Nina. Don't forget that."

She smiled against my mouth. "We're both terrified, aren't we?"

"Completely."

"But doing it anyway."

"Yeah."

"That's good. That's..." She searched for the word. "That's real."

Real. Yeah. This was real in a way nothing had been for two years. Real and messy and complicated and terrifying and absolutely right.

We went inside to make lunch for Betty, and the whole time I kept thinking about Thursday. About coming back to Junction City not as a trucker passing through but as someone who belonged here. Someone who had a reason to stay.

Someone who'd finally stopped running long enough to build a life.

It scared the hell out of me.

But not as much as losing Nina would have.

So I'd stay. I'd figure out how to be the kind of man who kept promises, who built roots, who chose commitment over safety.

I'd learn how to be home.

And maybe, just maybe, it would be enough.
