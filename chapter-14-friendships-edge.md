# Chapter 14: Friendship's Edge

"I need a favor," Nina says the next time I'm in Junction City, and there's hesitation in her voice like she's not sure she should ask.

"Anything."

"Grandma's porch has some loose boards. I tried to fix them myself but I don't have the right tools, and the handyman in town wants fifty dollars just to look at it. I know you're good with that kind of thing, so I thought..." She trails off. "Never mind. You probably don't have time."

"I have time. Show me."

Betty's Victorian house has good bones but it's old, and old houses need constant maintenance. The porch boards are loose enough to be dangerous, the front gate won't latch properly, and one of the bedroom windows sticks when you try to open it. Nina shows me everything apologetically, like she's asking too much.

"This is easy stuff," I tell her. "I can fix all of it this afternoon."

"Really?"

"Really. You got a toolbox?"

She does—her grandfather's tools, kept in the garage, dusty but functional. I spend the afternoon working on Betty's house while Nina helps when she can and Betty watches from the porch swing, knitting something that's gradually taking the shape of a scarf.

"You're good with your hands," Betty observes as I hammer down the loose porch boards.

"My dad taught me. We used to fix things together."

"He did a good job. Ryan, come sit for a minute. You've been working nonstop for two hours."

I put down the hammer and join Betty on the porch swing. Nina's inside making lemonade, and through the screen door I can hear her humming along to the radio. Something by Patsy Cline.

"You make her happy," Betty says quietly. "I hope you know that."

"She makes me happy too."

"Good. That's how it should be." Betty's hands move steadily with her knitting needles. "Can I ask you something, Ryan? And you give me an honest answer?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"What are your intentions with my granddaughter?"

It's the same question Sheriff Hayes asked, but from Betty it feels different. More personal. Like she's asking as family, not law enforcement.

"I love her," I say, and it's the first time I've said it out loud to anyone. "I'm in love with Nina. I want to build a life with her, if she'll have me. I just... I'm still figuring out how."

Betty nods like this is the answer she expected. "The 'how' is the hard part, isn't it? You've got the road, she's got me. Neither of you can easily give up what you're committed to."

"No, ma'am."

"But you're trying to figure it out."

"I am."

"Then that's enough for now." She pats my hand. "Just don't wait too long, Ryan. Life's shorter than we think, and time wasted is time you can't get back. If you love her, find a way to be with her. The rest will sort itself out."

Nina comes out with lemonade and the conversation shifts to lighter topics—Betty's church group, the weather, the new principal at Junction City High. But Betty's words stay with me as I finish the repairs, test the gate until it latches properly, make sure the window slides smooth.

By the time I'm done, it's evening and Betty insists I stay for dinner.

"I made too much pot roast anyway," she says, which is obviously a lie since she didn't know I'd be here. But I don't argue. The truth is, I want to stay.

Dinner around Betty's table feels like something I didn't know I was missing. Home-cooked food, conversation that flows easy, the warmth of being included in a family even if it's not mine. Nina sits across from me, her foot occasionally brushing mine under the table, and every time it happens we smile at each other like we're sharing a secret.

After dinner I help Nina with the dishes while Betty rests in her chair. We work in companionable silence—I wash, she dries, falling into a rhythm that feels practiced even though it's new.

"Thank you for fixing everything," Nina says. "You didn't have to do all that."

"I wanted to. Besides, I'm good at fixing things. Just not so good at fixing my own life."

She bumps my shoulder with hers. "You're doing better than you think."

When the dishes are done and it's fully dark outside, Nina walks me to the truck stop like she always does. But tonight feels different. Heavier. Like we're both aware we're teetering on the edge of something we can't take back.

We reach my truck and stand in the parking lot under stars that seem brighter than usual. October's turned cold enough that Nina's wearing a jacket, her hands tucked into the pockets.

"I don't want you to go," she says quietly.

"I don't want to go either."

"But you will. And in two weeks you'll come back. And we'll do this same dance of hello and goodbye, over and over, until..." She doesn't finish.

"Until what?"

"I don't know. Until one of us can't do it anymore, I guess."

The honesty of it hurts. She's right—we can't keep doing this forever. Eventually something has to change. Someone has to choose. Someone has to be brave enough to say what we both want but are too scared to ask for.

"Nina." I take her hand, pull it from her pocket, hold it between both of mine. "I meant what I told your grandmother. I love you. I'm in love with you. And I'm going to figure out how to make this work."

Her eyes are bright with unshed tears. "You say that like it's simple."

"It is simple. The logistics are hard, but the feeling is simple. I love you. That's the easy part."

"Then say it again."

"I love you."

"Again."

"I love you, Nina Lawson."

She's crying now, tears spilling over, but she's smiling too. "I love you too. I told you that already, but I'll keep saying it until you believe me."

"I believe you."

We stand there in the parking lot, holding hands, and the space between us feels charged with everything we've been not saying for months. I want to kiss her properly. Want to close the distance and show her how I feel instead of just telling her. But I'm also scared—scared of making this more real, scared of wanting her so badly that leaving becomes impossible.

But maybe that's the point. Maybe it should be impossible to leave. Maybe I should want her so much that staying becomes the only option.

I lean in slowly, giving her time to pull away if she wants to. She doesn't. Our lips meet and this kiss is different from the ones before—not hesitant, not uncertain. This kiss says I love you and I choose you and I don't know how we make this work but I want to try.

When we finally pull apart, Nina's breathless. "Wow."

"Yeah."

"You should probably go. Before I ask you to stay and we both know you can't."

She's right, but it doesn't make leaving any easier. I climb into my truck and she steps back, wrapping her jacket tight against the October cold. Through the windshield we look at each other, and I can see her trying not to cry.

I start the engine and pull out of the lot. In my rearview mirror, Nina's still standing there, watching me go. I drive until I can't see her anymore, then pull over at the first rest stop and sit in the dark cab trying to get my heart rate under control.

I'm in trouble. Deep, serious trouble. The kind you don't come back from.

I'm in love with Nina Lawson, and leaving her gets harder every single time. The highway used to feel like freedom. Now it just feels like the distance between me and where I want to be.

Falling in love wasn't part of the plan. But plans change. People change. And maybe I've changed enough that it's time to stop running and start building something permanent.

Maybe it's time to choose Junction City. Choose Nina. Choose staying.

The thought still scares me. But not as much as the alternative—keeping up this pattern until one of us breaks, losing her because I was too scared to fight for what we have.

Two years ago I left home because I felt unwanted, because staying hurt too much. But staying in Junction City wouldn't hurt. Staying with Nina would be choosing to be wanted, choosing to build instead of run, choosing love over fear.

I just have to be brave enough to do it.

I pull back onto the highway and drive through the darkness toward St. Louis, toward the next delivery, toward a life that suddenly feels too small for what I want.

Time to figure out what comes next.

Time to stop running and start staying.

Time to be the kind of man Nina deserves—one who shows up and stays instead of always leaving.

The highway stretches ahead, and for the first time in two years, I can see past the next mile marker. I can see a future that doesn't involve perpetual motion.

I can see Junction City. Betty's porch. Thursday afternoons. Nina.

I can see home.

Now I just have to find the courage to choose it.
