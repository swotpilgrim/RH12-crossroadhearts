# Chapter 12: His Route, Her Town

Nina's rearranging her life around my schedule.

"Judy's covering my Thursday lunch shifts now," she tells me over coffee in mid-September. "So I can have more time when you're here."

"Boyfriend." I test the word. "Is that what I am?"

Her smile falters. "I don't know. What are you?"

We've been doing this for three months—biweekly meetings, long conversations, that one kiss neither of us has mentioned. We hold hands. We talk like people who know each other well. But we've never labeled it.

"I'd like to be," I say. "Your boyfriend. If you want."

Her smile comes back brighter. "Yeah. I want that."

And just like that, we're something official. Something real. The thought should scare me more than it does, but mostly I just feel relieved that we've finally said it out loud.

The back corner booth becomes "our booth." Regulars know it's where Nina and I sit Thursday afternoons. Judy keeps it available. The other waitress, Doris, brings our orders without asking.

"Your girl's here," Doris says one Thursday, gesturing with her coffee pot.

My girl. The label feels foreign but good.

We're not hiding anymore. Can't hide, really—Junction City's too small for that. Everyone knows about "Nina Lawson and that trucker she's been seeing." I catch people watching us sometimes, curious but not hostile. Small-town nosiness, Nina calls it. Everyone wanting to know everyone else's business.

Sheriff Hayes makes it official one Thursday when he walks into the diner and heads for our booth. Nina's expression shifts—aware.

"Nina," Hayes says. Then to me: "Ryan."

"Sheriff."

He slides in next to Nina without asking. "Mind if I join you?"

"Course not," Nina says, nervous.

Hayes orders coffee, then studies me. "I've been hearing your name lately, Ryan. You've become a regular fixture."

"I stop through every two weeks. For the past three months now."

"Mmm-hmm. And always on Thursdays. Always for lunch. Always spending time with Nina here."

It's not a question, so I don't treat it like one. Just wait to see where this is going.

"My job," Hayes continues, "is to look out for this town and the people in it. Nina's one of our own. Her family's been here for generations. So when someone from out of town starts spending a lot of time with one of our girls, I pay attention."

"Sheriff Hayes—" Nina starts, but he holds up a hand.

"Let me finish, Nina. I've been watching, and from what I can see, Ryan here treats you right. Shows up when he says he will, buys you lunch, walks you around town like a gentleman. That's good. That matters." He turns back to me. "But I also know you're a trucker. You're here today and gone tomorrow. So I'm going to ask you straight—what are your intentions with Nina?"

I can feel Nina's embarrassment radiating off her, but I appreciate Hayes's directness. Better than wondering what people think.

"I care about her," I say. "A lot. And I know the logistics are complicated—I'm on the road, she's here. But I'm not just passing through anymore. Not when it comes to her."

Hayes studies me. "You planning to stick around? Make Junction City home?"

"I'm working on it."

First time I've said it out loud. I can feel Nina's surprise. We haven't talked about the future. But I've been thinking—about Tommy's regional route, an apartment near Junction City, seeing Nina more than twice a month.

Thinking about staying.

Hayes nods slowly. "All right then. Just know that if you hurt her, you'll have this whole town to answer to. Small places like Junction City, we take care of our own."

"Understood."

He finishes his coffee, drops a dollar on the table for Judy, and stands up. "Nina, your grandmother asked me to remind you about Sunday dinner. Says she's making pot roast."

"I'll be there, Sheriff."

Hayes tips his hat to both of us and leaves. The moment he's gone, Nina drops her face into her hands.

"I'm so sorry," she says, muffled. "Small towns are the worst. Everyone thinks they have a right to interrogate your boyfriend about his intentions."

"He's looking out for you."

"It's embarrassing."

"It's nice, actually." Growing up, nobody cared where I went. The idea of a whole town paying attention feels protective, not intrusive.

Nina peeks through her fingers. "You're serious?"

"Yeah."

She drops her hands. "You said you're working on staying. Did you mean it?"

"Yeah. Don't know how yet. But I'm figuring it out."

She takes my hand. "You don't have to change your whole life for me."

"What if I want to?"

We sit there holding hands across the table, and Judy walks by with a knowing smile but doesn't interrupt. The diner's busy around us, farmers and truckers and townspeople going about their Thursday routines, but in our booth it feels like we're in our own small world.

"There's a drive-in movie tonight," I say. "You want to go?"

"What's playing?"

"'Jailhouse Rock.' Elvis."

Nina grins. "I love Elvis. But I should check with Grandma first, make sure she's okay for the evening."

"I'll wait."

She squeezes my hand and slides out of the booth, heads to the pay phone by the restrooms to call home. I watch her go, and Judy appears with the coffee pot.

"You're good for her," Judy says, refilling my cup. "I've known Nina since she was in diapers, and I haven't seen her this happy in a long time. Since before her parents left, probably."

"She makes me happy too."

"Well, good. Just don't break her heart. Small towns have long memories." But she's smiling when she says it, so I know it's not a real threat.

Nina comes back beaming. "Grandma says yes, and that I should tell you she wants you to come to Sunday dinner if you're still in town."

"I'll be gone by Sunday. Back on the road tomorrow."

"She knows. She's just hopeful you'll stick around eventually." Nina sits back down. "So. Drive-in. What time?"

"Movie starts at eight. I'll pick you up at seven-thirty?"

"It's a date."

A real date. That evening Nina comes out in a yellow dress and cardigan, hair down. She looks beautiful and I tell her so. She blushes.

We're taking this slow, even though it doesn't feel slow anymore.

The drive-in is on the edge of town, a big screen facing rows of spots where cars park to watch. I back my truck in—easier to see from the cab than a regular car—and Nina climbs up to sit beside me. The lot fills up with couples and families, the smell of popcorn drifting from the concession stand.

When the movie starts, Nina settles back against the seat and I try to focus on Elvis singing and dancing on screen. But I'm hyperaware of Nina beside me—the way she laughs at the funny parts, how she unconsciously mouths along with the songs, the warmth of her shoulder almost but not quite touching mine.

Halfway through the movie, during a slow scene, her hand finds mine. Just rests there, fingers intertwined, natural as breathing.

I should be watching the movie. Should be paying attention to the screen. But all I can think about is Nina's hand in mine, how right this feels, how being here with her is better than any freedom I found on the highway.

This is what I've been missing, I realize. Not just companionship, but this—someone to sit with in comfortable silence, someone whose presence makes everything better, someone who chooses to spend her evening in a truck cab watching a movie because it means being together.

The movie ends and people start leaving, but we sit there a few minutes longer, neither of us ready for the evening to end.

"Thank you for this," Nina says quietly. "For staying longer. For the drive-in. For... everything."

"Thank you for putting up with a guy who's only here twice a month."

"You're here more than that now. In my head, I mean. I think about you all the time." She pauses. "Is that weird to say?"

"No. Because I think about you all the time too."

We sit there in the dark cab, the drive-in emptying around us, and I know I'm in too deep to ever go back to how things were. Junction City isn't just a stop on my route anymore. It's where Nina is. And that makes it the most important place in my world.

I drive her home and walk her to the porch. Betty's light is on inside but she doesn't come out, giving us privacy.

"I'll see you in two weeks?" Nina asks, and there's a question in it. Like she's checking that I'm still coming back.

"Two weeks," I promise. Then, because I can't help myself, I lean in and kiss her. Properly this time, not just her cheek. Her lips are soft and she makes a small surprised sound but then she's kissing me back, her hand on my chest, and for a moment the whole world narrows down to just this—just her.

When we pull apart, Nina's smiling. "Two weeks is too long."

"I know."

"But you'll come back."

"Always."

I drive away from Maple Street feeling lighter than I have in years. Junction City in my rearview mirror isn't something I'm leaving behind anymore. It's something I'm coming back to.

His route. Her town. Our future, if I can figure out how to build it.

And for the first time since Dad died, I actually believe I can.
