# Chapter 29: Better Than the Road

The next morning I moved my essential belongings into Mrs. Patterson's boarding house.

"Room's small but clean," she said, leading me up narrow stairs to the second floor. "Shared bathroom down the hall. Breakfast included if you're here for it. No guests after ten."

She gave me a pointed look on that last rule.

"Yes, ma'am."

"Nina's a good girl. You treat her right."

"I will."

"Good." Mrs. Patterson handed me the key. "Welcome to Junction City, Mr. Cross."

The room was exactly what she'd described: small, clean, a bed and dresser and lamp. Window overlooking Main Street. I could see the hardware store from here, the diner, the pharmacy.

I unpacked my duffel bag in five minutes. Everything I owned fit in two dresser drawers.

Two years on the road and this was all I had to show for it.

Time to build something more.

I reported to my new dispatcher in Kansas City that afternoon. Regional office was smaller than I expected—just three desks and a radio setup, cargo manifests tacked to bulletin boards.

"Ryan Cross?" The dispatcher was maybe fifty, gray hair, reading glasses on a chain.

"Yes, sir."

"Mike Harrison. We spoke on the phone." He shook my hand. "You ready to start?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. Got a load heading to Topeka tomorrow morning. Pick up at six, delivery by noon. You'll be back in Kansas City by dinner."

Back by dinner. Not two weeks from now. Not next Tuesday.

Dinner.

"Sounds good," I said.

"Most runs are like that. Kansas City to Topeka, Kansas City to Wichita, occasionally Salina or Lawrence. Two hundred mile radius. You'll know every truck stop by name within a month."

"Junction City part of the route?"

Mike smiled. "Heard about your girl there. Yeah, Junction City's in the coverage area. I'll make sure you get runs through there regular."

"Thank you."

"No problem. Just do good work and we're square."

I started the next day.

The routes were shorter than I was used to—four hours instead of fourteen. Delivered the load in Topeka, grabbed lunch at a truck stop that wasn't the Crossroads, headed back to Kansas City by two.

Strange finishing a route in daylight. Strange having somewhere to go that wasn't just another highway.

But strange started becoming normal.

I was back in Junction City three days later with a delivery to the grain elevator. Finished by noon, found Nina at the diner.

She looked up from the register, face lighting up when she saw me.

"You're back."

"Told you I would be."

"I know, but—" She shook her head. "It's different actually seeing it happen."

I sat at the counter. Judy brought me coffee without asking.

"Usual?" she asked.

"Yeah, thanks."

When Judy walked away, Nina leaned across the counter.

"What are you doing tonight?"

"Nothing. Why?"

"Drive-in's showing _Vertigo_. Want to go?"

A date. A real date. Not stolen hours between departures but actual plans.

"Yeah," I said. "I'd like that."

Nina grinned. "Pick me up at seven."

We went to the drive-in that night, Nina in her good dress, me in clean shirt and jeans. Parked in the back row, watched the movie through the windshield while eating popcorn.

Halfway through Nina leaned against me and I put my arm around her.

Normal. Ordinary. Perfect.

The weeks blurred together in the best way.

I ran routes to Topeka, Wichita, Lawrence. Back to Junction City every three days, sometimes sooner if Mike had a delivery that way.

Nina rearranged her diner shifts to match my schedule. We fell into routines: lunch when I arrived, dinner at Betty's house, walks by the creek when the weather was decent.

I fixed Betty's back porch rail that had been loose for months. Replaced the kitchen faucet that dripped. Helped carry groceries, moved furniture, hung Christmas lights.

Small things. Domestic things. The kind of things you do when you're part of someone's life instead of just passing through.

Junction City started feeling less like a stop on my route and more like the destination.

Sheriff Hayes nodded when he saw me on the street. Called me Ryan instead of Mr. Cross.

Judy teased me at the diner about being domesticated, but she smiled when she said it.

The mechanic at the truck stop learned my name, remembered I liked my coffee black, started setting aside the Junction City newspaper when he knew I'd be through.

I was becoming familiar. A regular. A resident.

Not just the trucker who showed up Tuesdays. The guy who was courting Nina Lawson. The one who was sticking around.

It should've felt claustrophobic—small town, everyone knowing my business, people remembering my patterns.

Instead it felt like belonging.

January came cold and clear. I'd been running regional routes for five weeks when the apartment above the hardware store opened up.

"Just one bedroom," Mr. Henderson said, showing me the space. "Kitchenette, bathroom, living area. Stairs from the street, separate from the store."

It was small. Smaller than the boarding house room. But it had windows with good light, hardwood floors, and it was mine.

"I'll take it," I said.

"You sure? Didn't even ask about the rent."

"I'm sure."

Mr. Henderson smiled. "Heard you're staying for Nina."

"Word gets around."

"Small town. Everyone's happy about it, if that matters. Nina's been alone too long. Good to see her happy."

"It matters," I said. "Thank you."

I signed the lease that afternoon. One year, first permanent address I'd had since Dad died.

Ryan Cross, 247 Main Street, Junction City, Kansas.

I stared at the paper and realized I'd just put down roots.

Nina helped me move in the next week. There wasn't much to move—my duffel bag, some clothes I'd bought at the general store, a radio, a few dishes.

"You need furniture," Nina said, looking around the empty living room.

"Yeah."

"And curtains."

"Probably."

"And pictures for the walls. Plants maybe. Something to make it feel like home."

"You offering to help with that?"

Nina smiled. "If you want."

"I want."

We spent the afternoon at the furniture store. Bought a couch, a table, a bed frame. The store owner promised delivery by Friday.

Nina picked out curtains at the general store—blue ones for the living room, simple white for the bedroom.

"Not too feminine?" I asked.

"It's either this or you live with bare windows and the whole town watching you sleep."

"Blue curtains it is."

We hung them that evening, Nina standing on a chair while I held it steady. She nearly fell twice and I caught her both times, and she laughed like it was the best thing that had happened all week.

When we finished, Nina stepped back to look at the apartment.

"It's starting to feel like home," she said.

"Yeah. It is."

She turned to me. "Are you happy?"

"Yeah. I am."

"Really? You're not missing the road? Not feeling trapped?"

"Really. I'm happy." I pulled her close. "This is what I was missing, Nina. This whole time on the highway, I was missing this."

"What?"

"Permanence. Partnership. Belonging somewhere." I kissed her forehead. "You were right. The road wasn't my life—it was where I was hiding from having one."

Nina wrapped her arms around my waist, tucked her face against my chest.

We stood in my small apartment above the hardware store on Main Street in Junction City, Kansas, and I felt more at home than I'd felt anywhere in two years.

The furniture arrived on Friday. Nina came over after her shift at the diner, helped me arrange everything. Couch by the window, table near the kitchenette, bed against the far wall of the bedroom.

She brought a plant from Betty's house—some green thing in a pot that apparently didn't need much care.

"Every home needs something living," she said, setting it on the table.

"I'm living here."

"Something living that won't forget to water itself."

Fair point.

By evening the apartment looked lived-in. Not fancy, but real. Mine.

Ours, maybe. Eventually.

Nina made dinner—nothing complicated, just grilled cheese and soup—but we ate at my table in my apartment in my town, and it felt more right than anything had in years.

"What are you thinking?" Nina asked.

"That I wasted two years."

"Doing what?"

"Looking for something that was here all along."

"What was here?"

"Home. The kind you build instead of the kind you're born into." I took her hand across the table. "You make anywhere feel like home, Nina."

She was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "You do the same for me."

We did dishes together, dried them and put them in my cabinets. Nina hung a calendar on the wall, marked the days I'd be back in Junction City based on my route schedule.

Thursday, Sunday, Wednesday, Saturday. Regular. Predictable. Present.

When she left that night, I walked her home through the quiet streets. Kissed her goodnight on Betty's porch.

Then I walked back to my apartment, climbed the stairs to my door, unlocked it and went inside.

My apartment. My town. My life.

I stood at the window looking down at Main Street. The hardware store was closed, the diner's lights still on with late customers. A car drove past, someone I didn't recognize but who probably knew me by name.

The highway was still out there—Highway 40 running east and west through town. I could see the Crossroads from here, the truck stop neon glowing against the dark sky.

Two years ago that highway was my whole world. The road meant freedom, meant escape, meant safety from anything that could hurt me.

But I'd been wrong.

The road wasn't freedom. It was loneliness disguised as independence. Motion disguised as purpose.

This was freedom. Choosing where I wanted to be and who I wanted to be with. Building something real instead of just passing through.

The road was still there. Would always be there. But now it led home instead of away from it.

And home was better than the road had ever been.

I turned off the lights and went to bed in my own apartment in Junction City, Kansas.

For the first time in two years, I didn't count the miles to the next departure.

I was already where I wanted to be.

I was home.
