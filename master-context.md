# Master Context: Rebel Heart Romance Series

## Project Overview

This is a series of standalone clean YA romance novels told from the male protagonist's perspective, set in 1950s small-town Americana. Each novel is a complete one-shot with NO continuity between books—new town, new characters, fresh story every time. The series captures the "rebel without a cause" energy of 1950s bad boys who fall for good girls, exploring themes of redemption, unworthiness, and transformation through love. Point Romance sophistication meets authentic male teen voice in gritty small-town settings where reputation matters and class divides run deep.
