# Chapter 30: Crossroads Choice

October 1958

We sat in our booth at the Crossroads Truck Stop, coffee going cold between us, and I asked Nina to marry me.

Not today. Not next week. Someday, when things settled and the time was right. But I wanted her to know I was all in. That this wasn't temporary. That I'd chosen her for keeps.

"Marry you?" Nina's eyes went wide.

"Eventually. Not asking you to pick a date or plan anything. Just asking if someday, when we're ready, you'd want to."

She stared at me for a long moment.

Then she laughed and started crying at the same time.

"Is that a yes?" I asked.

"Yes, you idiot. Yes."

I kissed her across the table, nearly knocking over the coffee, and Judy whistled from behind the counter.

"About time!" she called.

Nina pulled back, blushing. "Judy, stop."

"What? Whole town's been waiting for this boy to propose. I'm just saying what everyone's thinking."

She was probably right. Junction City had been watching us for ten months—the trucker who stayed for Nina Lawson. The drifter who put down roots. Small-town romance playing out in real time.

I didn't mind. Let them watch. Let them talk. I'd never been more certain of anything in my life.

"When did you decide?" Nina asked.

"Decide what?"

"That you wanted to marry me."

"Probably that first Tuesday. When you broke down at the truck stop and tried to fix your radiator yourself."

"That was ten months ago."

"Yeah. Took me a while to catch up to what I already knew."

Nina smiled, that soft smile that still made my chest tight.

Ten months.

Felt like a lifetime. Felt like yesterday.

I'd been running regional routes out of Kansas City since December, back in Junction City every few days just like I'd promised. The routes were predictable now—Kansas City to Topeka on Mondays, Wichita on Thursdays, Salina on Saturdays. I knew every truck stop, every diner, every mechanic by name.

But Junction City was home.

My apartment above the hardware store was fully furnished now. Nina's curtains in the windows, the plant she'd given me somehow still alive on the table. Pictures on the walls—me and Nina at the county fair, Betty on her porch, the Crossroads at sunset.

A life in snapshots instead of mile markers.

Betty's health had stabilized over the summer. New medication the doctor prescribed in March worked better than the old stuff. She was still weak, still needed help, but she'd made it through spring and summer without another crisis.

Gave us hope. Time. The space to breathe instead of just surviving.

Nina's parents had called from California in February. Surprised at first, but pleased to hear their daughter happy. They'd visit sometime, meet the man who'd convinced her to stay in Kansas.

Tommy had sent a telegram when he heard about the engagement: "About time. Congratulations. Beer's in the mail."

The case of Budweiser arrived three days later with a note: "Knew you'd figure it out eventually. Proud of you, kid."

I'd called him from the pay phone at the truck stop, thanked him for everything.

"You did the hard part," Tommy said. "I just gave you the option. You chose to take it."

Choosing. That's what it came down to.

Nina squeezed my hand across the table.

"What are you thinking about?" she asked.

"How different everything is from a year ago."

"Good different?"

"Best different."

She smiled. "Me too."

Through the diner window I could see Highway 40 stretching east and west, the intersection with Highway 77 where the Crossroads sat. Two roads meeting, people passing through on their way to somewhere else.

Crossroads.

Decision points. Every junction a choice between continuing straight or turning toward something new.

I'd spent two years on Highway 40, never stopping long enough to choose. Just kept driving, telling myself motion meant freedom.

But motion meant fear. Fear of building something that could break. Fear of letting people matter.

The road felt safe because it couldn't ask anything of me. Couldn't break my heart.

But safety wasn't happiness. Running wasn't living.

Meeting Nina changed everything. Made me want to stop at the crossroads instead of blowing through. Made me want to turn toward Junction City instead of continuing on to the next town.

Made me want to choose something instead of just drifting.

"I'm proud of you," Nina said quietly.

"For what?"

"For being brave. For staying. For choosing this even though it scared you."

"You were brave first. You're the one stuck in Junction City taking care of Betty when you could've been in California."

"I'm not stuck. I'm choosing to be here. There's a difference."

Yeah. There was.

Choosing to stay wasn't the same as being trapped. Choosing commitment wasn't giving up freedom—it was using freedom to build something that mattered.

Took me two years and meeting Nina to figure that out.

"What happens now?" Nina asked.

"Now we keep building. Keep choosing each other. Get married someday when the time's right."

"And then?"

"And then we have a life. Here in Junction City. Normal and ordinary and real."

Nina smiled. "I like the sound of that."

"Me too."

Judy brought us fresh coffee without asking, winked at Nina.

"Congratulations, honey. You landed yourself a good one."

"Thanks, Judy."

After Judy walked away, Nina leaned across the table.

"Do you ever miss it?" she asked. "The long-haul routes. The constant motion. Going wherever you wanted."

"Sometimes," I admitted. "Not the loneliness. Not the running. But sometimes I miss the simplicity. The way the road didn't ask anything of me except to keep driving."

"And?"

"And then I remember what I have here. You. Betty. This town. An actual life instead of just existing between destinations." I took her hand. "Missing something doesn't mean I made the wrong choice. Just means I'm human."

"What if you wake up one day and the missing is worse than what you have?"

"Then I'll tell you. And we'll work through it. But Nina, I've been here ten months. Had plenty of days to regret this choice or wish I was somewhere else. Know how many times that's happened?"

"How many?"

"Zero. Not once. Because this—" I gestured between us, around the diner, toward Junction City beyond the windows "—this is better than anything I had on the road. Better than I thought life could be."

Nina's eyes filled with tears.

"Stop making me cry in public," she said.

"Can't help it. You asked."

She laughed, wiped her eyes.

We sat in our booth drinking coffee while Junction City moved around us. Trucks pulled in and out of the Crossroads parking lot, drivers grabbing food and fuel before heading back to Highway 40. East to Kansas City, west to Denver, south to Oklahoma.

Always moving. Always heading somewhere else.

That used to be me.

The guy who never stopped. Never stayed. Never let Junction City be more than a name on a map and a place to grab lunch on Tuesdays.

But I'd been wrong about everything.

Home wasn't the place you came from. It was the place you chose to build. The person you chose to build it with.

The highway was still out there. Would always be out there. And maybe someday I'd take Nina on a long drive, show her the places I'd seen, the roads I'd traveled.

But I wouldn't be running anymore.

Because I'd finally arrived.

The bravest journey wasn't the thousands of miles I'd driven across the country. It was the choice to stop running. The choice to let myself be loved. The choice to believe I deserved the happiness Nina offered.

It was choosing to stay when every instinct told me to run.

It was choosing home.

We finished our coffee and walked out to the parking lot. My Peterbilt sat near the back—same truck I'd been driving for two years, but now it took me home instead of away from it.

Nina leaned against me, her head on my shoulder.

"I love you, Ryan Cross."

"I love you too."

"What time do you leave tomorrow?"

"Early. Five AM run to Topeka. But I'll be back Thursday."

"Thursday," Nina repeated. Like she was marking it on a calendar in her mind. "I'll make dinner."

"Your place or mine?"

"Yours. I want to practice cooking in your kitchen."

Our kitchen, I thought. Someday.

When we got married. When Nina moved in officially. When my apartment became our home instead of just mine.

Someday soon.

I kissed her under the Crossroads neon sign, the place where Highway 40 and Highway 77 met, where people usually just passed through on their way to somewhere else.

But I wasn't passing through anymore.

I was home.

And home was exactly where I wanted to be.

---

One year later, we married in the Junction City Methodist church with Betty in the front row and half the town in attendance.

Tommy came from Omaha to be my best man. Nina's parents flew in from California. Judy cried through the ceremony.

Sheriff Hayes gave Nina away. Said it was his honor, that he'd been watching us build this love and was proud to see it made official.

We honeymooned in Colorado—two weeks driving through mountains, staying in motels and diners. The road was beautiful.

But coming home to Nina was better.

We built a life in Junction City. I kept running regional routes, eventually saved enough to buy my own truck and started doing local deliveries exclusively. Nina kept working at the diner until Betty passed peacefully in her sleep in 1962.

After that, we bought Betty's house on Maple Street. Fixed it up, made it ours.

Had two kids—a boy and a girl. Raised them in Junction City, same small town where their parents fell in love at a truck stop crossroads.

I never regretted staying. Never woke up wishing I was somewhere else. Never resented Nina for being the reason I stopped running.

Because she wasn't the reason I stopped.

She was the reason I started living.

The crossroads is still there. Highway 40 and Highway 77 meeting in Junction City, Kansas. The Crossroads Truck Stop serving coffee and pie to travelers passing through.

But I'm not passing through anymore.

I'm home.

And I chose it.

That's the difference.

That's everything.
