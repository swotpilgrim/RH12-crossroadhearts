# Chapter 16: The Midpoint

I wasn't supposed to be in Junction City on a Thursday. My route had me coming through on Tuesdays, regular as clockwork, but Tommy'd shifted the schedule around and here I was pulling into the Crossroads Truck Stop two days off pattern. I told myself it didn't matter, that I wasn't hoping Nina would be there anyway.

I was lying to myself. I'd been doing a lot of that lately.

The sky had that heavy look to it, clouds stacked up dark and low over the Kansas plains. August heat made the air thick enough to chew on. I parked the Peterbilt in my usual spot and walked across the lot toward the diner, and there she was—Nina, coming out of the Main Street Diner down the road, her shift just ending by the look of it. When she saw my truck, her whole face changed. Lit up like sunrise.

Something in my chest did this stupid flip.

"You're early," she called out, jogging across the parking lot. Her dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and she had on a yellow sundress that made her look like summer itself. "I wasn't expecting you until Tuesday."

"Schedule change," I said, and my voice came out rougher than I meant it. "Tommy's got me running a different rotation."

"Lucky for me." Nina smiled, but there was something tired around her eyes. Something worried. "Have you eaten yet?"

"Was about to."

"Mind if I join you?"

Like I'd ever say no.

We took our usual booth, cracked red vinyl and a view of the parking lot. Judy brought coffee with a knowing grin that made my neck heat up. Nina ordered a Coke and fries. I got the meatloaf special.

The first drops of rain hit the windows as Judy walked away.

"Storm's coming," Nina said, watching the glass. Her fingers played with the edge of the paper napkin on the table, nervous. Not like her.

"You okay?"

She looked at me then, and I saw it—the weight she was carrying, the thing she'd been holding back. "I took Grandma Betty to the doctor yesterday."

My gut tightened. "What'd he say?"

"The medication isn't working as well anymore." Nina's voice stayed steady but her hands kept worrying that napkin, folding and unfolding it. "Her heart's getting weaker. He adjusted the dosage, but he said..." She stopped, swallowed. "He said we need to be realistic about what's ahead."

I didn't know what to say to that. Didn't have words for the look on Nina's face, for the fear I could see her trying to hide. So I did the only thing I could think of—I reached across the table and took her hand.

Her fingers were cold despite the August heat.

"I'm scared, Ryan." The words came out quiet, almost a whisper. "What if I can't—what if she gets worse and I can't handle it? What if I'm not enough?"

"Hey." I squeezed her hand. "You're taking care of her. You're doing everything you can. That's enough."

"Is it?" She looked down at our hands, hers small in mine. A strand of dark hair had come loose from her ponytail, falling across her cheek. Without thinking, I reached up with my other hand and tucked it behind her ear.

The gesture felt more intimate than anything I'd done in my life.

Nina went still. Then she looked up at me, and the expression on her face—trust and affection and something deeper, something that made my chest ache—just about undid me.

Outside, the rain started for real, drumming on the diner roof.

I should've pulled back, made some joke, put distance between us like I always did. But I couldn't move. Couldn't think of anything except Nina looking at me like I mattered.

Judy brought our food but I barely noticed. The rain was coming down harder now, turning the parking lot into a mess of puddles and running water. Nina picked at her fries but didn't eat them. I pushed my meatloaf around the plate.

"We should go," I said finally. "Before it gets worse."

"Go where?"

"My truck's right outside," I said. "We could wait it out there."

Something flickered in Nina's eyes—awareness that my truck cab was different than a public booth. But she nodded, and we ran through the rain to the Peterbilt.

By the time we climbed into the cab, we were both soaked. Nina laughed, breathless, pushing wet hair out of her face. I found an old flannel shirt wadded up behind the seat and handed it to her.

"For your hair," I said.

She dried her face and hair while rain hammered the metal roof, loud and deafening, creating a cocoon around us. Private. Separate from everything.

Nina sat in the passenger seat looking small and beautiful, and I knew I was in deep trouble.

"Thank you," she said. "For listening. About Grandma Betty."

"Anytime."

"I mean it, Ryan. You're..." She paused, searching for words. "You're the only person I can really talk to. Judy's sweet but she doesn't understand. My parents keep calling from California telling me to put Betty in a home and come out there, like it's simple. Like I could just abandon her."

"You won't," I said. "That's not who you are."

"How do you know?" The question was genuine, curious. "You barely know me."

That wasn't true. I knew she took her coffee with too much sugar and got quiet when worried. Knew she loved her grandmother more than anything. Knew she saw people—really saw them, past the walls they put up. She saw the real me, not just the drifter passing through.

"I know enough," I said.

Nina held my eyes, and something shifted in the air between us. The rain kept pounding on the roof, sealing us in, and my heart was beating too hard.

"Ryan—"

I kissed her.

Didn't plan it, didn't think about it. Just leaned across the space between the seats and kissed her the way I'd been wanting to for months. Properly. Really.

For half a second Nina went still with surprise. Then her hand came up to my jaw, her fingers cool against my skin, and she kissed me back.

The world narrowed down to just this: Nina's mouth on mine, her hand on my face, the rain drumming overhead like percussion. She tasted like Coca-Cola and something sweeter, and when I pulled her closer she came willingly, trust and want all tangled together.

When we finally broke apart, both breathing hard, I knew with absolute certainty what I'd been trying not to admit for weeks.

I was in love with her.

Completely, terrifyingly in love.

"Ryan." Nina's voice shook. Her hand was still on my jaw, thumb brushing my cheekbone. "I need to tell you something."

"Yeah?" I could barely get the word out.

"I'm falling for you." Her eyes were huge, dark in the dim light of the cab. "I've been falling for you for months, and I don't know what to do about it because you're always leaving and I'm always staying and this can't—we can't—"

I kissed her again, cutting off the protest. She was right—this was impossible, the logistics didn't work. But I couldn't make myself care when Nina kissed me back like I was something precious.

When we separated this time, I rested my forehead against hers. Closed my eyes. Tried to find words for what was happening in my chest.

"I know," I said finally. "I know it's complicated."

"Complicated." Nina laughed, but it sounded close to crying. "That's one word for it."

"Nina—"

"Tell me this isn't just passing time for you." She pulled back enough to look at me, and the vulnerability in her face just about killed me. "Tell me I'm not just another town on your route."

"You're not." The words came out fierce, certain. "You've never been that."

"Then what am I?"

The answer sat in my throat, too big to say. Admitting what Nina meant would mean admitting I wanted things I'd spent two years running from. That Junction City felt more like home than anywhere since my father died. That I wanted to stay, but didn't know how.

"You're important," I said instead. Inadequate, but true. "You matter, Nina. More than—" I stopped, swallowed. "More than anything."

Her eyes filled with tears. "I don't want to say goodbye every two weeks anymore. I don't want to watch you drive away knowing it'll be another fourteen days before I see you. I want—" Her voice broke. "I want things we can't have."

"I know." I pulled her close again, and she came, tucking her face against my shoulder. I could feel her shaking. "I know, honey. I know."

We sat like that while the rain poured down, and I knew everything had changed. Couldn't pretend this was casual or temporary anymore.

I was in love with Nina Lawson. That meant wanting to be the kind of man who deserved her—the kind who stayed instead of ran, who could look at a small Kansas town and see home instead of a cage.

I didn't know if I could be that man. But sitting there with Nina in my arms, I wanted to try.

"We should probably talk about this," Nina said eventually, her voice muffled against my shirt.

"Probably."

"Figure out what happens next."

"Yeah."

Neither of us moved. Outside, the rain was letting up, the storm passing as quickly as it had come. Soon I'd have to let Nina go, watch her walk back to Betty's house, point this truck toward the rest of my route.

But not yet.

For now, I held her and let myself believe love was enough to overcome logistics. Let myself pretend we could make this work.

Even though I had no idea how. Even though everything in me said I'd mess this up, that I wasn't built for staying.

I held her anyway, memorizing how she felt in my arms. Tried to burn this moment into my memory for when I left.

Because I'd be leaving. I always did.

The question was whether I'd ever figure out how to come back for good.
