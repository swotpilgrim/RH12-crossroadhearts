# Chapter 19: Betty's Decline

I got to Junction City two days late.

Tommy'd added an extra run, and by the time I reached the Crossroads Truck Stop it was Thursday instead of Tuesday. I pulled into the lot half-expecting Nina wouldn't be there.

But her old Chevy sat near the diner entrance.

Relief hit me hard. I sat in the cab for a minute, just breathing.

I walked toward the diner, November air cold enough to see my breath.

Inside was warm, smelling of coffee and onions. Nina sat in our booth, coat still on, coffee in front of her.

When she looked up, I expected her to smile. Expected relief, that light in her eyes.

Instead she looked exhausted. Worried. Like she'd been carrying something too heavy for too long.

"Hey," I said, sliding into the booth across from her.

"Hey." Her voice was quiet. Flat.

"Sorry I'm late. Tommy had me running extra—"

"It's okay." Nina wrapped her hands around the coffee cup, not looking at me. "I wasn't sure you'd come."

That stung. "I always come."

"I know." She finally met my eyes, and what I saw there made my chest tighten. Fear. Exhaustion. Something close to breaking. "Ryan, I need to tell you something."

"Okay."

She took a breath. "Grandma Betty had an episode two days ago. Tuesday morning. She called the diner, said she felt dizzy, couldn't breathe. I found her on the floor by the stairs. Her legs gave out."

"Christ, Nina. Is she—"

"She's alive." Nina's hands shook around the coffee cup. "Dr. Morrison came, examined her. Said her heart's weaker than he thought. The medication isn't working. He adjusted it, but he said we need to be realistic about what's ahead."

I reached across the table, covered her hands with mine. Ice cold.

"What does that mean?"

"She's not getting better. This is as good as it gets. Maybe six months, maybe a year. Probably not longer. And she needs more care now—help with stairs, bathing, constant monitoring so she doesn't fall again."

"What about your parents? Can they help?"

Nina laughed, but it came out bitter. "They called yesterday. Told me I'm being selfish, that I should put Grandma Betty in a nursing home and come to California like they've been asking. Said it's not fair for me to sacrifice my life for someone who's just going to die anyway."

The way she said it—like she was quoting them, like those were the actual words they'd used—made me furious on her behalf.

"They said that?"

"Close enough." Nina wiped her eyes. "My father's worried. He thinks I'm wasting my youth, stuck here while he's in California. But I can't abandon her, Ryan. She raised him in that house. Fifty years she's lived there. I can't put her in some facility where she'd fade away alone."

"I know."

"Do you?" Desperation in her voice. "Everyone keeps saying I should. My parents, Judy, even Sheriff Hayes. Like it's crazy to take care of my own grandmother."

"It's not crazy. It's loyal."

"It's impossible." Harsh. "The diner's cutting my hours. I'm running out of money. I'm exhausted. And the doctor says it's getting worse, that Betty needs more help than I can give."

She was crying now, not trying to hide it anymore, and I didn't know how to fix this. Didn't know how to make any of it better.

All I could do was slide out of my side of the booth and into hers, pull Nina against my chest, and hold her while she cried.

She shook in my arms, months of fear pouring out while Elvis played on the jukebox.

"I'm scared," Nina whispered. "What if I can't do this?"

"You're the strongest person I know."

"I don't feel strong. I feel like I'm drowning."

I tightened my arms around her, chin on top of her head. She smelled like vanilla. Still Nina, even under all the exhaustion and fear.

"What do you need?" I asked. "Tell me how to help."

She was quiet for a long minute, and when she finally spoke her voice was so small I almost didn't hear it.

"I need someone to tell me I'm doing the right thing. That I'm not crazy for choosing to stay here, for giving up everything to take care of her. I need—" She stopped, swallowed. "I need to not feel so alone."

The words hit like a punch.

Nina _was_ alone. Her parents in California, her friends well-meaning but not understanding. And me? Rolling through every two weeks, then driving away.

I was making this harder.

"You're not crazy," I said. "You're doing the right thing."

"Am I?" Nina pulled back to look at me, face blotchy from crying. "It feels wrong, Ryan. Like I'm trapped. I love Grandma Betty, but sometimes I lie awake thinking about California. About starting over, having a life that's mine."

"That's normal. That doesn't make you bad."

"Doesn't it?" She wiped her eyes. "What kind of granddaughter resents this?"

"The human kind." I brushed hair from her face. "You can love someone and still wish things were different. That's honest."

She stared at me for a long moment, and I could see her trying to believe it. Trying to give herself permission to feel what she was feeling without guilt.

"I don't know how long I can keep doing this," she said. "The diner, the caregiving, waiting for my life to start. I'm stuck here twenty-four-seven, Ryan. Can't leave her alone. Can't make plans. Can't even think about a future."

And there it was. The question underneath everything.

_Where do we fit?_

Nina was more stuck than ever. I was still leaving. The logistics had just gotten worse.

"What did Morrison say about care?" I asked. "What does Betty need?"

"Someone there. Help with bathing, dressing, medication. Monitoring for falls. He recommended a home health aide, but I can't afford it. Medicare might cover some, but the paperwork could take weeks."

"What about church ladies?"

Nina almost smiled. "Betty calls them 'church busybodies.' Says they'll gossip. She's too proud for charity."

"Even if it means you running yourself into the ground?"

"She thinks she's fine. That I'm overreacting." Nina leaned against my shoulder. "I'm so tired, Ryan. I don't remember the last time I slept more than four hours."

I held her and felt completely helpless. This wasn't something I could fix with a wrench and electrical tape. This was real life, complicated and messy and impossible, and I didn't have solutions.

What I had was a truck route that took me away from Junction City for two weeks at a time. What I had was a life on the road that couldn't accommodate what Nina needed. What I had was fear that I'd only make things worse if I tried to be something I wasn't.

But sitting there with Nina in my arms, feeling her shake with exhaustion and fear, I knew something had changed.

I couldn't keep doing this—showing up, taking what comfort and connection she offered, and then leaving her alone to deal with everything. It wasn't fair. It wasn't right.

Nina deserved someone who could actually be there. Who could help with Betty, who could share the burden, who could tell her at three in the morning that she was doing the right thing and mean it because he was there, present, not a voice on a pay phone from three states away.

She deserved someone who stayed.

And I still didn't know if I could be that person. But for the first time, sitting in that truck stop booth with Nina crying against my shoulder, I knew I had to figure it out.

Because watching her break under the weight of everything she was carrying, and knowing I was part of that weight instead of part of the solution—that was worse than any fear I'd been running from.

"I'm sorry," I said into her hair. Inadequate words, but all I had.

"For what?"

For not being enough. For making this harder. For loving you but not knowing how to stay.

"For not being here when Betty fell," I said instead. "For only seeing you every two weeks. For... all of it."

Nina was quiet for a moment. Then she said, so soft I almost missed it: "I can't keep doing this either, Ryan. The goodbye every time you leave. It's killing me."

And I knew—sitting there with my arms around her, her words hanging in the air between us—that something was going to break.

Either I was going to figure out how to stay, how to be what Nina needed, how to build a life that included her and Betty and Junction City.

Or Nina was going to do the smart thing and tell me to stop coming around. Stop giving her hope for something that couldn't work. Stop making the constant leaving hurt worse than it already did.

I didn't know which one scared me more.

But I knew we couldn't keep going like this.

Something had to change.
