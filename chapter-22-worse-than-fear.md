# Chapter 22: Worse Than Fear

The truck stop in Missouri was nothing special. Another diner, bad coffee, another place between towns.

I'd been sitting here for an hour, staring at a burger I couldn't eat, when the realization hit.

Avoiding Nina wasn't protecting me from pain. It was guaranteeing it.

Four weeks since I'd walked out of the Crossroads and left Nina in that booth. Four weeks on the Kansas City-Tulsa run, bypassing Junction City completely.

Four weeks of telling myself this was better.

Four weeks of being miserable.

I pushed the burger away, lit a cigarette even though I was inside and the waitress gave me a look. Didn't care. Nothing mattered much these days.

The door opened and Dale Cooper walked in, spotted me, came over uninvited.

"You look worse than last time," he said, sitting down across from me.

"Thanks, Dale."

"I'm serious, kid. What the hell's wrong with you?"

"I'm fine."

"Still lying." Dale flagged down the waitress, ordered coffee. "You end it with that Junction City girl?"

I didn't answer.

"How's that working out?"

"It's not."

"Then why'd you do it?"

Because Nina asked me to. Because the logistics were impossible. Because I was terrified of failing someone who mattered.

Because running felt safer than staying.

Except four weeks in, it didn't feel safe. It felt like the stupidest mistake I'd ever made.

"She ended it," I said. "Said she couldn't do the goodbye cycle anymore. So I gave her what she wanted—stayed away, let her move on."

Dale snorted. "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

"Excuse me?"

"Kid, if a woman tells you goodbye is too hard, she's not saying she wants you gone. She's saying she wants you to stay."

The words hit me hard. Made me think of Nina in that booth, voice breaking when she said _I can't keep doing this_. The look on her face when I walked away. Like I was giving up on her. On us.

Like I was choosing the road over her.

"It's more complicated than that," I said.

"It's really not." Dale's coffee arrived. He took a sip, made a face. "Look, I told you about Amarillo. About the woman I didn't choose. You want to know why I really let her go?"

"Why?"

"Because I was scared." Dale said it flat, matter-of-fact. "Scared she'd realize I wasn't worth staying for. Scared I'd screw it up. Scared that being what she needed meant giving up who I was. So I told myself I was choosing freedom, choosing the road, choosing adventure. Know what I was really choosing?"

"What?"

"Cowardice." Dale looked at me hard. "Safety. The road can't break your heart, can't leave you, can't realize you're not enough. It's easier to be alone than risk being disappointed or disappointing someone else. So I chose easy over brave. And I've regretted it every day for thirty years."

Hands shaking, I stubbed out my cigarette.

"What if she's moved on? What if four weeks was too long?"

"Then you live with it. But at least you tried." Dale stood. "Stop running, kid. Whatever you're running from already caught you. Might as well face it."

He left. I sat there and realized he was right.

Two years running from pain. From my father's death, from my mother moving on, from the fear I wasn't enough. Motion wasn't freedom—it was escape.

But not risking anything didn't protect me. It just guaranteed loneliness.

And losing Nina hurt worse than any fear I'd been running from.

I was in love with her. Completely, terrifyingly in love. That wasn't going away just because I avoided Junction City. Wasn't disappearing because I drove different routes and pretended she didn't exist.

If anything, it was worse. Because now I spent every mile thinking about her. Wondering if she was okay, if Betty was stable, if Nina had stopped looking for my truck on Tuesdays. Wondering if she hated me for walking away, or if she understood, or if she'd already started moving on.

The not knowing was killing me.

And more than that—the regret was killing me. The knowledge that I'd had something real, something worth keeping, and I'd let it go without a fight because I was too scared to try.

Dale's words echoed: _Whatever you're running from has already caught you._

He was right. I couldn't outrun this. Couldn't drive far enough or fast enough to escape the fact that I loved Nina and letting her go was the worst mistake I'd ever made.

So what was I doing? Sitting in a Missouri truck stop, miserable and alone, telling myself this was better?

It wasn't better. It was just safer.

And safety wasn't worth a damn if it meant losing her.

I pulled out my wallet, found the business card I'd been carrying for months. Regional Routes Manager, Kansas City. The number Tommy'd given me ages ago, the path toward actually having a life instead of just passing through one.

I'd been too scared to call it. Too scared of what it meant—giving up long-haul, settling down, building roots, becoming the kind of man who stayed instead of ran.

But what was the alternative? Becoming Dale? Thirty years alone, full of regrets, wondering what my life could've been if I'd been brave enough to choose different?

That future terrified me more than staying ever could.

I looked at the card. Looked at the pay phone on the wall. Looked at the highway through the diner window, stretching endlessly in both directions.

For two years, the highway had been escape. Safety. The answer to every question about where I belonged.

But now all I could see was the miles between me and Nina. Between where I was and where I wanted to be.

Between running and home.

I stood up, left money on the table, walked to the pay phone. Dropped quarters in with shaking hands.

The Regional Routes office answered on the third ring.

"This is Ryan Cross," I said. "I'm a long-haul driver with Tommy's Freight out of Omaha. I'm calling about regional positions."

"Let me transfer you to the manager."

Hold music. My heart pounded so hard I could hear it over the tinny sound.

This was it. The moment where I chose different. Chose Nina, chose staying, chose being brave enough to want something more than endless highway.

"Mike Harrison, Regional Manager."

"Yeah, hi. My name's Ryan Cross. I drive long-haul now but I'm looking to transition to regional routes. Shorter runs, home more often. Based out of Kansas City if possible."

"Okay." I could hear papers shuffling. "How long you been driving?"

"Two years. Clean record, no accidents, reliable."

"Your boss give you a reference?"

"Tommy Sullivan, Tommy's Freight in Omaha. He'll vouch for me."

"All right. I've got a couple options. One's Kansas City to Topeka, Kansas City to Wichita, that area. Two hundred mile radius, home every few days. Pay's less than long-haul but hours are better. You interested?"

Home every few days. Junction City was in that radius. I could make Junction City my home base, take the short runs, actually be there instead of just passing through.

If Nina would have me. If I hadn't burned that bridge completely.

"Yeah," I said. "I'm interested."

"When can you start?"

"Soon as you need me."

"Let me get your information, talk to your current boss, run the background. If everything checks out, you could start in two weeks."

Two weeks. Fourteen days. Then I'd be off long-haul for good, running regional routes, based out of Kansas City with Junction City in my coverage area.

Then I could go to Nina. Actually go to her, not as a trucker passing through but as someone who'd chosen to stay. Someone who'd made real changes instead of just promising empty words.

We worked through the details—my license number, contact information, schedule availability. When I hung up twenty minutes later, my hands were still shaking but for a different reason.

I'd done it. Actually done it. Requested the transfer off long-haul, started the process toward a life that wasn't just perpetual motion.

Started the process toward Nina.

If she'd have me. If four weeks wasn't too long. If I hadn't destroyed everything by walking away when she needed me to fight.

But at least I'd be trying. At least I wouldn't end up like Dale, full of regrets and what-ifs, wondering what could've been if I'd just been brave enough.

I walked back to my truck, climbed into the cab, sat there staring at nothing.

This was terrifying. Changing everything, giving up the safety of the road, building a life in one place instead of scattered across a dozen states. Risking my heart on a woman who might've already moved on, might say no, might realize I wasn't worth the trouble.

But you know what was worse than that fear?

The certainty of losing Nina without trying. The guaranteed pain of safety. The hollow, empty, miserable existence I'd been living for four weeks without her.

That was worse. That was unbearable.

So I'd face the fear instead. Go to Nina in two weeks with an actual plan, an actual life I could offer her. Tell her I was sorry for walking away, sorry for not fighting, sorry for choosing safety over her.

Tell her I was done running. Done being a drifter. Done letting fear dictate my life.

Tell her I loved her and I wanted to stay.

And if she said no—if she'd moved on or couldn't forgive me or just didn't want to risk it again—at least I'd know. At least I could live with the certainty instead of the what-ifs.

At least I'd be able to look at myself in twenty years and know I'd tried.

I started the engine. I still had runs to finish, a couple more weeks of long-haul before the regional position started. But for the first time in four weeks, the highway didn't feel like prison.

It felt like the road toward something instead of away.

Toward Nina. Toward Junction City. Toward the terrifying, beautiful possibility of actually being brave enough to stay.

I pulled out of the Missouri truck stop and pointed the Pete toward Kansas City.

Time to finish what I'd started. Time to stop running.

Time to go home.
