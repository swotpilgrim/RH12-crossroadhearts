# Chapter 20: Too Hard to Say Goodbye

Two weeks later, I pulled into Junction City on a cold Tuesday.

The Crossroads Truck Stop looked the same—neon signs, big rigs, diesel and snow in the air. But everything felt different. Heavy.

I found Nina in our booth, coffee already cold. She'd been waiting awhile.

"Hey," I said, sliding in across from her.

"Hey." Nina smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. She looked exhausted—dark circles, messy ponytail, old cardigan.

Still beautiful. Still Nina. But something had shifted, gone somewhere I couldn't follow.

Judy came over with the coffee pot, filled my cup, gave us both a look that was equal parts sympathy and concern. "You two eating, or just coffee today?"

"Just coffee," Nina said before I could answer.

Judy walked away. Silence felt loud.

I wrapped my hands around my coffee. Outside, a truck pulled west on Highway 40. I watched it go, something twisting in my chest.

"How's Betty?" I asked.

"Same. Weaker, maybe. Stairs are harder. Morrison adjusted her medication yesterday. I don't think it's helping." Nina stared at her coffee. "Medicare approved the home health aide. Starts next week. Four hours, three times a week."

"That's good."

"Yeah." She sounded defeated.

I wanted to reach across the table, take her hand, tell her it would be okay. But I didn't know if that was true anymore, and I was tired of making promises I couldn't keep.

"Ryan." Nina looked up at me, and the expression on her face made my stomach drop. "We need to talk."

Four words. That's all it took for me to know what was coming.

"Okay," I said, even though nothing about this felt okay.

Nina took a breath, let it out slow. Her hands were shaking around the coffee cup. "I can't do this anymore."

There it was. The thing I'd been afraid of since the day I kissed her in the rain. The inevitable moment when Nina realized I wasn't worth the pain.

"Do what?" I asked, even though I knew.

"This." She gestured between us. "You and me. The every-two-weeks thing. The hello and goodbye and counting days until I see you again. I can't—" Her voice cracked. "I'm falling apart, Ryan. And every time you leave it hurts more, and I can't keep doing it."

"Nina—"

"Let me finish." She wiped her eyes. Crying. "Please. I need to say this."

I nodded, throat tight.

"I'm in love with you," Nina said, and the words should've made me happy but they just hurt. "I've been in love with you for months. And that's the problem, because you're always leaving and I'm always staying and we can't—there's no future here, Ryan. You know that as well as I do."

"We could figure something out—"

"How?" The question came out sharp. Desperate. "Tell me how we make this work. You've got routes that take you all over the country. I've got a grandmother who can't be left alone for more than a few hours. You live out of a truck. I live in Junction City. Where's the middle ground? Where's the part where this doesn't end with both of us heartbroken?"

I didn't have an answer. Wanted one, needed one, but came up empty.

"I can't ask you to give up your life for me," Nina continued. "That wouldn't be fair. The road is who you are, what you do. I'd never ask you to stop. But I also can't keep living for the two days every couple weeks when you're here. I can't keep saying goodbye and pretending it doesn't destroy me a little more each time."

"So what are you saying?" I asked, even though I knew. Needed to hear it anyway.

"I'm saying you should stop coming to Junction City." Nina's voice broke completely now. "I'm saying we should end this before it gets worse. Before we're in so deep that walking away becomes impossible."

"Nina—"

"I'm already in that deep, Ryan. I'm already at the point where losing you is going to break me. But if we keep going, if we keep pretending this can work when we both know it can't..." She shook her head. "I need to protect myself. I need to focus on Betty, on getting through the next months or year or however long she has. I can't do that if half my heart is on Highway 40 waiting for you to come back."

I wanted to argue. Wanted to tell her she was wrong, that we could make this work, that I'd figure something out. But the words stuck in my throat because she wasn't wrong.

We were impossible. The logistics didn't work. I was a long-haul trucker and she was a small-town girl stuck caring for her dying grandmother, and love didn't fix any of that.

"I don't want to lose you," I said, and my voice came out rough.

"I don't want to lose you either." Nina reached across the table, took my hand. Her fingers were cold, shaking. "But I'm losing myself, Ryan. Every goodbye takes a piece of me. Every time I watch your truck pull away I die a little. I can't keep doing it. I'm not strong enough."

"You're the strongest—"

"Don't." She pulled her hand back. "Don't tell me I'm strong. I'm not. I'm breaking, and you're part of what's breaking me, and I hate that. I hate that loving you hurts this much."

The words hit like a punch. I'd known—somewhere deep down I'd always known—that I was hurting her. That showing up every two weeks was selfish, giving us both something we couldn't keep. But hearing her say it out loud made it real in a way I couldn't ignore.

"I'm sorry," I said. Inadequate, but all I had.

"I know." Nina wiped her eyes again. "I know you are. This isn't your fault, Ryan. It's just... the situation. The timing. The fact that we met at the wrong time in the wrong place and fell for each other anyway."

"Is there a right time?" I asked. "A right place?"

"I don't know. Maybe." She looked at me with so much sadness I could barely stand it. "Maybe if we'd met when Betty was healthy and I could leave Junction City. Maybe if you weren't on the road. Maybe in some other life where the logistics actually worked. But not this one. Not now."

We sat in silence, the truth of it settling between us like snow. The jukebox was playing something slow and sad—Patsy Cline, maybe, singing about heartbreak. Outside, another truck pulled into the lot. Life kept moving even when it felt like everything was ending.

"So this is it?" I asked. "I just... stop coming?"

"Yeah." Nina's voice was barely a whisper. "You stop coming. I stop waiting. We both move on and try to forget this ever happened."

"I'm not going to forget you, Nina."

"I'm not going to forget you either." She smiled, but it was the saddest thing I'd ever seen. "But we have to try. For both our sakes."

I wanted to fight this. Wanted to tell her no, that I'd find a way to make it work, that she was worth more than running. But the words wouldn't come because I didn't know how to back them up. Didn't know how to be what she needed.

And Nina deserved more than empty promises from a guy who'd spent two years running from anything that felt like commitment.

"I should go," I said, even though leaving was the last thing I wanted to do.

"Yeah." Nina didn't move. "You should."

Neither of us stood up. We sat there in our booth at the Crossroads Truck Stop, coffee going cold between us, and I tried to memorize everything about this moment. The way Nina's dark hair caught the light from the window. The curve of her jaw. The sadness in her eyes. The way my chest ached just looking at her.

I tried to burn it all into my memory so I could carry it with me when I drove away.

Because I would drive away. That's what I did. That's who I was.

Finally, I stood. Pulled out my wallet, left money on the table for both our coffees.

"Take care of yourself," I said. Words that meant nothing and everything.

"You too," Nina whispered.

I wanted to kiss her goodbye. Wanted to pull her into my arms one last time, feel her heartbeat against my chest, pretend for just another minute that this wasn't ending.

But that would only make it harder.

So I walked away. Left Nina sitting in the booth, left the truck stop, left Junction City. Climbed into my Peterbilt and sat there for a minute with my hands on the steering wheel, trying to breathe through the pain in my chest.

This was the right thing. Nina was right—we couldn't keep doing this. The constant goodbye was killing both of us. Clean break was kinder than slow torture.

I knew all that. Understood the logic.

Didn't make it hurt any less.

I started the engine. The Peterbilt rumbled to life, familiar and solid beneath me. In an hour I'd be in Salina. By tonight I'd be in Kansas City. Tomorrow I'd be on a different route, heading toward a different town, and Junction City would just be another stop I used to make.

Nina would go back to Betty's house, back to caregiving and diner shifts and the daily grind of Junction City life. Eventually she'd stop looking for my truck on Tuesdays. Eventually she'd stop thinking about the trucker who used to stop through.

Eventually we'd both move on.

I told myself that as I pulled out of the parking lot, pointed the truck east on Highway 40. Told myself it would get easier, that distance would make this hurt less, that in a few weeks or months I'd be fine.

But when I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the Crossroads Truck Stop disappearing behind me, all I felt was hollow.

Like I'd just left the best thing that ever happened to me sitting in a booth with cold coffee, and I was too much of a coward to go back and fight for her.

Too scared to stay. Too broken to try.

Just... gone.

Like I always was.
