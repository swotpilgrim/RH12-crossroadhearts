# Chapter 23: The Drive Back

I called Tommy from a pay phone in Missouri, hands shaking as the quarters dropped.

"Tommy's Freight."

"It's Ryan. I need to talk to you."

"Hold on." Muffled sounds, then Tommy's voice. "What's going on?"

"I need to come in. Person. Today, if you can swing it."

Pause. "Where are you?"

"Missouri. But I can be in Omaha by tonight if I drive straight through."

"This about that regional position?"

My chest tightened. "You know about that?"

"Mike Harrison called me yesterday for a reference. I told him you're reliable, skilled, and clearly losing your mind over some girl but that's your business." Tommy's voice was dry. "So yeah, I know. You coming to give notice?"

"If that's okay."

"Ryan, you've been a good driver. If you need to make a change, I'm not going to stand in your way. Come to the office tomorrow morning. We'll work out the transition."

"Thanks, Tommy."

"Don't thank me yet. You sure about this? Regional's less money, less freedom. You've been running long-haul for two years. That's a big change."

Was I sure? Two days ago I would've said no. Would've said the road was who I was, that settling down meant losing myself.

But sitting in that Missouri truck stop listening to Dale talk about thirty years of regrets had changed something. Made me realize the road wasn't freedom—it was just fear with better scenery.

"I'm sure," I said.

"All right. See you tomorrow."

I hung up, climbed back into the Peterbilt, and drove.

Missouri to Omaha was about four hundred miles, straight shot north. I pushed through, stopping only for gas, making it to Tommy's office by nine that night. Found a motel, slept badly, showed up at the warehouse at seven the next morning.

Tommy was in his office, coffee already half-gone, paperwork spread across his desk.

"You look like hell," he said when I walked in.

"Yeah, well."

"Sit down." Tommy gestured to the chair across from him. "Let's talk."

I sat. Tried to figure out how to explain what I was doing without sounding crazy.

Tommy saved me the trouble. "Mike Harrison says you can start the regional position in two weeks. That work for you?"

"Yeah."

"You've got three runs left on your current schedule. Finish those, bring the truck back here, we'll settle accounts and get you transitioned." Tommy leaned back, studied me. "You want to tell me what changed? Last I heard, you'd requested the Tulsa run to avoid Junction City. Now you're taking a regional position that puts you right back there."

"I made a mistake," I said. Simple as that.

"With the girl?"

"Yeah."

"She know you're coming back?"

"No." My stomach twisted. "I don't even know if she'll want to see me. I walked away four weeks ago. She might've moved on. Might tell me to go to hell."

"But you're going anyway."

"Yeah."

Tommy was quiet for a minute. Then he opened a drawer, pulled out an envelope, slid it across the desk.

"What's this?"

"Last paycheck, plus your accrued time off. You've got about three hundred hours saved up—two years' worth. I'm cashing it out." Tommy tapped the envelope. "Use it to get yourself settled. Find an apartment in Kansas City or Junction City, wherever makes sense. Get your life in order before you start the new position."

I stared at the envelope. "Tommy, I can work the next two weeks—"

"I know you can. But you won't. Not well, anyway. You'll be distracted, thinking about that girl, probably driving like an idiot." Tommy's expression softened. "Look, kid. I've been where you are. Remember what I told you about Ellen? About how I drove long-haul for two years after I met her, miserable the whole time because I was too scared to give up the road?"

"Yeah."

"You know what I wish I'd done different?"

"What?"

"Made the change faster. Stopped wasting time being scared and just committed." Tommy leaned forward. "You've got a chance to do this right. Don't drag it out. Finish your current run, come back here, settle things, then go to Junction City and fight for her. Don't wait two weeks second-guessing yourself."

The envelope felt heavy in my hands. This was real. Actually happening.

"What if she says no?" I asked.

"Then you know. But at least you tried." Tommy smiled. "Besides, from what I've seen of you the past six months, that girl's already got you. Question's whether you're brave enough to admit it."

Fair point.

I finished up the paperwork—signatures, final route assignments, transition details. By noon I was back in the Peterbilt heading south toward Kansas to finish my last few runs.

The highway felt different now. Not like prison, not like escape. Just... road. Miles between where I was and where I wanted to be.

I had three runs left. Kansas City to Wichita and back. Kansas City to Topeka. Then one final long-haul to St. Louis and back to Omaha to return the truck.

After that, I'd be officially off the road. Officially regional. Officially based out of Kansas City with Junction City in my coverage area.

Officially able to build a life instead of just passing through one.

The thought terrified me. But the alternative—going back to endless highway, empty truck stops, Dale Cooper's future—terrified me more.

I finished the Wichita run, then Topeka, moving through them mechanically. The other drivers noticed I was off, asked if I was okay. I told them I was fine, which was a lie. I wasn't fine. I was scared out of my mind.

But I was also determined. For the first time in two years, I knew what I wanted. Knew where I was going. Knew that motion wasn't the answer—Nina was.

The St. Louis run was my last. I picked up the load in Kansas City, drove east through familiar territory. Passed the exit for Junction City and felt my chest tighten.

Soon. Not today, but soon.

I had to do this right. Had to have a plan, an actual life I could offer her. Showing up empty-handed with just apologies and promises wouldn't cut it. Nina deserved more than that.

So I'd get settled first. Find an apartment, start the regional position, prove to myself I could do this—could build roots, could stay in one place, could be the kind of man who had a life Nina could fit into.

Then I'd go to her.

I delivered the St. Louis load, turned the truck around, drove back to Omaha. Pulled into Tommy's yard at dusk, parked the Peterbilt in its spot, sat in the cab for a minute.

This was it. Last time in this truck. Last time as a long-haul driver. Last time running.

I climbed down, walked into Tommy's office. He was still there, working late as usual.

"All done?" he asked.

"Yeah. Truck's clean, full tank, paperwork's in the cab."

"Good." Tommy pulled out a file folder. "Your final check, reference letters for the regional position, and a contact for an apartment complex in Kansas City. Friend of mine manages it, said he'd give you first month half-off if you mention my name."

I took the folder, overwhelmed. "Tommy, you didn't have to—"

"Yeah, I did. You're a good kid, Ryan. You deserve a shot at being happy." Tommy stood, held out his hand. "Good luck. With the job, with the girl, with all of it."

I shook his hand. "Thanks. For everything."

"Stay in touch. Let me know how it goes."

I walked out of Tommy's Freight for the last time, duffel bag over my shoulder, folder of paperwork under my arm. My car was still parked in the back lot where I'd left it two years ago, battery dead but otherwise fine.

Tommy'd had someone jump it for me. I threw my stuff in the trunk, climbed behind the wheel, and sat there for a minute.

Two years ago I'd parked this car and climbed into a Peterbilt, told myself the road was freedom. Told myself I was choosing adventure over pain, motion over the risk of staying still.

Now I was climbing back into the car, pointing it toward Kansas City, toward a regional routes position, toward Nina. Toward the terrifying, beautiful risk of actually building a life.

I started the engine. It turned over rough but steady.

The drive to Kansas City took three hours. I found the apartment complex Tommy'd mentioned, talked to the manager, signed a six-month lease on a one-bedroom that was small but clean and mine.

My first permanent address in two years.

I moved in with almost nothing—duffel bag of clothes, a few books, toiletries. The apartment echoed empty, but it was a start.

Tomorrow I'd call Mike Harrison, confirm my start date for the regional position. Day after that I'd go to Junction City.

Go to Nina.

Tell her I was sorry. That I'd been scared and stupid and wrong. That I'd made changes—real changes, not just promises. That I had a regional position now, an apartment in Kansas City, a life she could actually fit into.

Tell her I loved her and I wanted to stay.

And hope to God four weeks wasn't too long. Hope she'd hear me out. Hope I hadn't burned that bridge completely.

I sat in my empty apartment and rehearsed what I'd say.

_Nina, I'm sorry. I was wrong to walk away. I love you. I got a regional position—I'll be in Junction City every few days instead of every two weeks. I found an apartment. I'm not running anymore. I'm staying. For you. If you'll have me._

Simple. Honest. Probably not enough, but all I had.

I tried to sleep but couldn't. Lay awake staring at the ceiling of my new apartment, thinking about Nina. About the look on her face when I'd walked away. About whether she'd forgive me.

About whether I was about to get my heart broken or finally get it right.

Either way, tomorrow I'd find out.

Tomorrow I'd drive to Junction City, walk into that truck stop, and see if the girl I loved was willing to give a reformed drifter another chance.

Tomorrow I'd stop running and start fighting.

Tomorrow I'd find out if coming home was the bravest thing I'd ever done or the most painful.

I just hoped I wasn't too late.
