# Chapter 3: Broken Down

Two weeks pass like they always do—miles of highway, different towns that all look the same, loads picked up and delivered, the steady rhythm of driving and sleeping and driving again. When my route brings me back through Junction City, I don't think about it being Junction City specifically. It's just the midpoint stop, the place where I eat lunch and fuel up before pushing on to St. Louis.

It's early July now, heat shimmering off the highway even at noon, the kind of Kansas summer heat that makes the air feel thick. I pull into the Crossroads Truck Stop around twelve-thirty, park the rig in my usual spot, and head inside where the air conditioning hits like a blessing.

The diner's busy for a weekday lunch—farmers and truckers and a few townspeople scattered at the counter and booths. I find a stool near the window end of the counter, order a burger and fries and sweet tea from the waitress I'm starting to recognize. She doesn't ask what I want, just says "the usual?" and I nod. Apparently burger and fries has become my usual. I hadn't noticed.

The food arrives quick and I eat without really tasting it, looking out the window at the parking lot while I chew. Trucks coming and going, cars pulling in for gas, the ordinary midday traffic of a crossroads truck stop. The sweet tea is cold enough to make my teeth ache, and I drink half of it in one long pull.

That's when I see her.

A girl in the parking lot, standing in front of an old Chevy sedan with the hood up, steam rising from the engine in a white plume that's visible even from inside the diner. She's maybe seventeen, dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, wearing a blue sundress that's too nice for wrestling with a broken car. She leans over the engine bay, pulls back quick when more steam billows out, and even from here I can see the frustration on her face.

I should mind my own business. That's the rule I live by—other people's problems aren't my problems, getting involved leads to complications, better to stay in my lane and keep moving. I turn back to my burger and take another bite.

But something makes me glance back out the window. The girl's circling the car now, hands on her hips, looking at the engine like maybe if she stares hard enough it'll fix itself. She wipes her forehead with the back of her hand, and I can tell from here that she's close to giving up. Or crying. Maybe both.

I know that feeling. That helpless frustration when something breaks and you don't know how to fix it and you're alone with the problem. I've been there, though usually with truck issues in the middle of nowhere instead of a car in a parking lot.

Still not my problem.

I eat another fry. Look back at the girl. She's bent over the engine again, and this time when she straightens up I see her expression clearly—scared and frustrated and trying not to show either. She's alone out there in the midday heat with a broken car and no idea what to do about it.

Damn it.

I push back from the counter, leave my half-eaten burger, and walk outside. The heat hits me like a wall after the air-conditioned diner. The girl doesn't notice me approaching—she's too busy staring at the engine like it personally offended her.

"Need some help?" I ask, stopping a few feet away. Don't want to spook her by getting too close.

She jumps a little, startled, and turns to look at me. Up close she's younger than I thought, maybe just graduated high school, with dark eyes and a wary expression. She takes in my appearance—work boots, jeans, white t-shirt with grease stains, probably look like every other trucker in the lot—and her wariness increases.

"I'm fine," she says, which is clearly a lie given the steam still rising from her engine.

"Car doesn't look fine," I point out, keeping my voice neutral, non-threatening. "Radiator?"

She glances back at the engine, then at me, weighing whether to accept help from a stranger or keep pretending she's got it under control. Pride wars with practicality on her face.

"It just… started steaming," she finally admits. "I don't know why. I was driving and the temperature gauge went up and I barely made it here before it died."

"Mind if I take a look?"

She hesitates, then steps back, gesturing toward the engine like she's granting permission. I move closer, careful not to crowd her, and lean over to look at the problem. The engine's a straight-six, old but well-maintained from what I can see. Steam's coming from near the radiator. I wait for it to dissipate a bit, then carefully check the hoses.

"There's your problem," I tell her, pointing to the upper radiator hose. "Split right here. See? Coolant's leaking out, that's why it overheated."

She leans in to look where I'm pointing, careful not to get too close to me. "Can it be fixed?"

"Needs a new hose. But I can patch this one temporarily if you want. Get you to a mechanic."

"You can do that?"

"Got some electrical tape in my truck. Won't hold forever, but it'll get you where you need to go. Probably."

She looks at me like she's trying to figure out if this is some kind of trick or if I'm genuinely offering to help. I get it—small-town girl, stranger in a truck stop parking lot, she's right to be cautious. But I can see the moment she decides to trust me, or at least decides she doesn't have better options.

"That would be… really helpful. Thank you."

"Give me a minute."

I walk back to my truck, grab the electrical tape from my toolbox behind the seat, and return to her car. She's standing by the front bumper now, arms crossed, watching me with that same wary-but-grateful expression.

"What's your name?" she asks as I lean back over the engine.

"Ryan."

"I'm Nina. Nina Lawson."

"Nice to meet you, Nina." I wrap the tape tight around the split in the hose, overlapping it several times to make sure it holds. "This is just a temporary fix. You'll need to get this replaced for real. Drive straight to a mechanic, don't stop, don't push it. The tape won't hold if it gets hot again."

"Is there a mechanic in Junction City?"

"Auto shop on Main Street, I think. Or the garage here might do it."

I finish with the tape, step back, wipe my hands on my jeans. "Try starting it. Carefully. If the engine's cooled down enough, it should run."

Nina slides into the driver's seat, turns the key. The engine coughs, sputters, then catches and rumbles to life. No steam this time, at least not immediately. She lets it run for a minute, watching the temperature gauge like it's going to betray her, then gets back out.

"It's working," she says, and the relief in her voice is so complete it makes me glad I stopped. "Thank you so much. I thought I was going to be stuck here all day. Can I pay you? For the tape and your time?"

"No need."

"But—"

"It's just tape. Don't worry about it."

She looks like she wants to argue, but she just nods. "Well. Thank you. Really."

"Get it to a mechanic," I remind her. "Today if you can. That tape won't last."

"I will. Today. I promise."

There's an awkward moment where neither of us knows if the conversation is over. Nina shifts her weight, glances at her car, then back at me.

"Are you just passing through?" she asks. "Junction City, I mean."

"Yeah. I'm a trucker. This is one of my stops."

"Oh." She seems to think about this. "Well. Thank you again. For helping."

"No problem."

She gets back in the car, closes the door, gives me a little wave through the window. I step back and watch as she carefully pulls out of the parking lot, the Chevy running rough but running. She heads toward Main Street, hopefully to the auto shop like I told her.

I stand there for a minute in the heat, watching her car disappear down the road. Then I shake my head, walk back into the diner, and slide onto my stool. My burger's cold now, the fries limp and greasy. The waitress notices me sitting back down and comes over.

"Helping out a damsel in distress?" she asks with a knowing smile.

I shrug. "Car trouble. Just needed a quick fix."

"That's real nice of you, honey." She refills my tea without asking. "You want me to get the kitchen to make you a fresh burger?"

"No, this is fine."

She gives me a look that says she doesn't believe me but moves on to the next customer anyway. I eat the cold burger mechanically, wash it down with sweet tea, and try not to think about the way Nina looked relieved when the car started. Like I'd done something heroic instead of just wrapping tape around a hose.

It wasn't heroic. It was basic human decency. She had a problem, I had a solution, end of story.

When I'm done eating I pay the check and head back to my truck. I've got another four hours to St. Louis and I've already spent too much time on this lunch break. I climb into the cab, start the engine, pull out of the lot.

Highway 40 stretches east, familiar and empty. I light a cigarette and settle into the drive, mind already shifting to the delivery schedule, the route, the next stop.

I don't think about Nina Lawson.

Don't think about her dark eyes or the way she looked so out of place in that sundress trying to fix a car. Don't think about how young she seemed, or how alone, or how grateful she looked when the engine started.

It was just a random encounter, the kind that happens all the time on the road. Someone needs help, you help if you can, then you move on. By tomorrow I won't even remember her name.

That's how it works when you're always moving. People blur together. Moments don't stick. This time next week, the girl with the broken-down Chevy will be just another face I can't quite recall, another town I passed through, another mile marker behind me.

I tell myself that's true as the highway unrolls ahead and Junction City disappears in my rearview mirror.

Just another stop. Just another stranger. Just passing through.

Nothing more than that.
