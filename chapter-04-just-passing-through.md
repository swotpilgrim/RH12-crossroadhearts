# Chapter 4: Just Passing Through

The cold burger sits heavy in my stomach as I drain the last of my sweet tea. Through the window I can see my Peterbilt right where I left it, patient and waiting, ready to take me away from Junction City and back to the familiar rhythm of the highway.

The waitress swings by with the coffee pot even though my cup's empty, and when she sees me pushing the plate away she grins.

"That was real sweet of you," she says, "helping that girl out there."

I shrug. "Wasn't anything. Just needed tape."

"Still. A lot of folks would've kept eating and let someone else deal with it." She tears my check off her pad, sets it face-down on the counter. "She looked real grateful."

"Car just overheated. Happens."

The waitress—her name tag says JUDY, I notice for the first time—gives me a look that's equal parts knowing and amused. Like she can see something I'm trying to hide. But what is there to hide? I helped someone with car trouble. End of story.

"Well," Judy says, refilling the coffee cup of the trucker next to me, "we could use more gentlemen like you around here."

I don't respond to that, just pull out my wallet and leave enough bills to cover the meal and tip. The lunch rush is starting to thin out now, a few farmers heading back to their fields, one of the truckers paying his check and heading for the door. I should've been back on the road twenty minutes ago.

Outside, the July heat is even worse than when I went in. Must be pushing ninety-five, the kind of dry prairie heat that bakes the moisture right out of you. I light a cigarette as I walk to the truck, squinting against the bright sun reflecting off chrome and windshields.

Four hours to St. Louis. Maybe closer to five with the heat slowing traffic. I've got a delivery scheduled for tomorrow morning, which means I need to find a place to park tonight, grab some sleep, be at the warehouse by eight. Plenty of time if I don't waste any more of it.

I climb into the cab and the vinyl seat is hot enough to burn through my jeans. I crank the windows down, start the engine, let it idle while I adjust the mirrors and check the gauges. Everything looks good. Fuel gauge shows three-quarters full, plenty to get me to St. Louis. Oil pressure normal. Temperature normal—unlike Nina Lawson's Chevy.

I pull out of the lot without looking back, swing onto Highway 40 heading east. The truck settles into its comfortable rumble, tires humming on hot asphalt, engine steady and strong. This is what I know. This is what makes sense.

Junction City disappears behind me almost immediately, swallowed by the flat Kansas landscape. In my side mirror I can see the red neon CROSSROADS sign getting smaller, then it's gone and there's just highway and sky and endless fields of wheat rippling in the heat.

My mind drifts as I drive, the way it always does on long straight stretches. Autopilot takes over—hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, but thoughts wandering. Usually I think about nothing in particular. The route ahead, what I'll eat for dinner, whether Tommy's got another load lined up after St. Louis. The practical things that make up a trucker's day.

But today my mind keeps going back to the parking lot. To Nina standing there in her blue sundress looking lost and frustrated. The way her face changed when the car started—relief and gratitude all mixed together. The way she said "thank you" like I'd done something worth thanking instead of a five-minute fix with electrical tape.

I shake my head, light another cigarette off the one I'm finishing. Doesn't matter. It was a random encounter, the kind that happens all the time when you're on the road. Last month I helped an old man change a tire outside Topeka. Week before that I gave directions to a family that was lost near Kansas City. You help when you can because someday you might be the one who needs help. That's the code of the road. Nothing special about it.

The highway stretches ahead, heat shimmer making it look like water in the distance. I've driven this stretch so many times I could probably do it with my eyes closed. Past the grain elevator at mile marker 312. Past the abandoned gas station at 315. Through the nothing-town of Brookville that's just a crossroads with a few houses. Every landmark familiar, every mile identical to the last time I drove it and the time before that.

That's what I like about the highway. The sameness. The predictability. Unlike people, who are complicated and messy and full of expectations you can't meet, the road is simple. You drive, you deliver, you drive again. Clear rules, clear purpose, no room for disappointment.

I crack the window wider, let the hot wind blast through the cab. The cigarette tastes like ash and distance. On the radio—I finally turn it on, need something to push back the silence—some newscaster is talking about Eisenhower and the economy and things I don't care about. I twist the dial until I find music. Chuck Berry, "School Day," upbeat and fast.

Better.

The music fills the cab and I let it, drumming my fingers on the steering wheel in time with the beat. This is good. This is normal. Highway miles and radio music and nothing to think about except the next town, the next stop, the next delivery.

Nina Lawson's probably at the mechanic by now. Getting her radiator hose replaced, paying for the repair, going back to whatever her life is in Junction City. Working some job, living with her family, dating some local boy who's known her since kindergarten. The kind of small-town life that would suffocate me. She'll fix her car and go back to her routine and by tomorrow she'll barely remember the trucker who helped her in the parking lot.

That's how it should be. That's how it works.

People cross paths on the road all the time. Brief intersections, then diverging trajectories. You help each other out when needed, exchange a few words, then move on with your separate lives. No attachments, no obligations, no messy emotions. Clean and simple.

The mile markers tick by. 320. 325. 330. Each one taking me further from Junction City, closer to St. Louis, deeper into the familiar rhythm of driving that requires nothing from me except attention and endurance.

I think about stopping for coffee at the truck stop in Salina, but I've still got half a thermos from this morning and I don't want to lose any more time. The delivery schedule is loose but I like to build in buffer time, arrive early rather than scrambling at the last minute. That's the kind of trucker I am—reliable, punctual, professional. Tommy knows he can count on me to get the load there intact and on time. That's all he needs from me, and that's all I need to give.

Simple. Uncomplicated. No room for failure or disappointment.

The afternoon wears on. The sun shifts from straight overhead to angled in front of me, making me squint even with the visor down. I pull my sunglasses from the dash, slide them on. Better. The glare lessens and I can see the highway clearly again, stretching east toward Missouri and the delivery and the next load and the load after that.

Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm aware that in two weeks my route will bring me through Junction City again. Same midpoint stop, same truck stop, same lunch counter. I might see Nina Lawson again, might not. Junction City's small but I don't exactly travel in local circles. She's probably got her own places she goes, her own routine that doesn't include hanging out at truck stops.

And even if I do see her, so what? We'll nod at each other, maybe exchange a "hey, how's the car running?" and that'll be it. Strangers who once helped each other in a parking lot. Nothing more.

That's fine. That's exactly how it should be.

The sun's getting lower now, the heat starting to break just slightly. I'll make St. Louis by early evening, find a place to park, grab some dinner and sleep. Tomorrow I'll make the delivery, call Tommy for the next load, keep the wheel turning.

This is my life and I'm good at it. Good at the driving, good at the solitude, good at keeping everything simple and surface-level. No complications. No attachments. No risk of caring about something enough that losing it could hurt.

The highway doesn't care if you're lonely. Doesn't care if you left home at eighteen because you felt replaced and unwanted. Doesn't care if you're running from grief or toward something you can't quite name. It just keeps going, mile after mile, and as long as you keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road, it'll take you wherever you point it.

That's enough.

It has to be enough.

I push the Peterbilt a little harder, watching the speedometer climb. The engine responds smoothly, eating up the miles with steady power. By the time the sun sets I'll be across the Missouri state line, Junction City a hundred miles behind me, Nina Lawson a fading memory that won't even stick past next week.

Just another stop. Just another stranger. Just another day on the road where nothing changes and nothing matters beyond the next delivery.

The way it should be. The way I need it to be.

The radio crackles and I adjust the dial, finding another station. Elvis now, "All Shook Up," and the irony isn't lost on me but I leave it on anyway. The music fills the cab, fills my head, pushes out the image of dark eyes and a blue sundress and a relieved smile.

I don't need to remember that. Don't need to remember her.

In two weeks when I pass through Junction City again, I'll have forgotten Nina Lawson's name. She'll be just another face that didn't stick, another brief encounter that didn't mean anything. That's how it works when you're always moving—people blur together into a stream of strangers and none of them matter enough to remember.

That's freedom. That's safety. That's the life I chose and the life I'll keep choosing.

Highway 40 unrolls ahead of me, endless and familiar and uncomplicated.

Just the way I like it.

Just passing through.
