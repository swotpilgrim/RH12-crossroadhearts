# Chapter 8: Every Two Weeks

It becomes routine.

Every two weeks, my route brings me through Junction City around lunch time, and every two weeks, Nina's at the Crossroads Truck Stop waiting. Sometimes she's already in the back booth with a book or paperwork from the diner. Sometimes she walks in five minutes after I do, face lighting up when she sees me. But she's always there.

And I'm always looking for her.

The fourth time it happens—mid-August, heat baking the Kansas prairie until even the air feels tired—Nina slides into the booth across from me and says, "So I have a confession."

"Yeah?"

"I might have been asking the cook at my diner to watch for your truck. He can see the highway from the kitchen window, and when he spots that blue Peterbilt heading into town, he tells me."

"And then you come here."

"And then I come here." She doesn't look embarrassed about it. "Is that weird? Tell me if it's weird."

It should be weird. Should set off every alarm bell I've spent two years cultivating about attachment and expectations and people depending on me showing up. But all I feel is a warm satisfaction that she wants to see me badly enough to arrange her schedule around mine.

"It's not weird," I say.

Her smile is bright enough to make me forget the temperature outside. "Good. Because I really look forward to Thursdays now."

So do I. But saying that out loud feels like admitting too much, so I just pick up my coffee and take a long drink.

We fall into patterns. I order meatloaf or pot roast, comfort food that reminds me of home cooking I don't get anywhere else. Nina rotates through sandwiches and fries, occasionally splurging on pie if Judy's made something good that day. We talk while we eat, conversation flowing easier every time, building on what we learned in previous meetings.

Nina tells me about Junction City. About Grandma Betty's stories of the town sixty years ago, when it was even smaller and everyone knew everyone's business even more than they do now. About the breakfast regulars at her diner—farmers who've been ordering the same meal for twenty years, businessmen who read newspapers and never make eye contact, the occasional trucker passing through who tips well and never comes back.

"I've gotten good at reading people in the thirty seconds it takes to pour coffee," she says one Thursday. "You can tell a lot about someone by how they treat the person serving their food."

"What did you read about me? That first time."

Nina considers this, head tilted. "You looked uncomfortable. Like you'd rather be anywhere else but also like you needed to help because that's what you do. Protective instinct stronger than self-preservation instinct."

"That's pretty specific."

"I pay attention." She steals one of my fries—she's been doing that lately, casual comfort I don't mind. "You're not as mysterious as you think you are."

"I'm not trying to be mysterious."

"You're trying to be something. Invisible, maybe. Unmemorable. Like if you don't let anyone really see you, they can't hurt you when you leave."

The observation hits too close to the truth. I deflect with humor. "You get all that from pouring coffee?"

"No," she says quietly. "I get that from watching you avoid every personal question I've asked for the last month and a half."

A month and a half. Six meetings. Twelve weeks since I first helped her with the car. Time that should've been forgettable has somehow become the thing I look forward to most.

"Sorry," I say. "I'm not good at the personal stuff."

"I know. It's okay." She takes another one of my fries. "But someday you might trust me enough to tell me why you left home at eighteen. Just saying."

Someday. Like she's thinking long-term. Like these biweekly meetings might continue indefinitely. The thought should scare me more than it does.

I share trucker stories instead of personal history. Tell her about the time I hauled a load of live chickens that got loose in the trailer somewhere outside Topeka, spent two hours chasing down escapees in a truck stop parking lot while other drivers laughed. About the weird guy at a rest stop in Missouri who claimed he was being followed by the government and tried to convince me to check my truck for tracking devices. About sleeping through a thunderstorm so loud it shook the truck cab, waking up to find I'd been parked next to a tornado siren that had been blaring for twenty minutes.

Nina laughs at the right parts, gasps at the near-misses, asks questions that show she's really listening. "Don't you get lonely?" she asks during one lunch. "All that time alone on the road, no one to talk to, just you and the highway?"

"I'm used to it," I say. "Lonely implies wanting something different. I chose this life."

"But do you still choose it? Or are you just living with a choice you made when you were eighteen and didn't know any better?"

It's the kind of question that would annoy me coming from anyone else—too probing, too personal. But from Nina it just makes me think. Do I still choose this? Or am I just going through the motions because it's easier than figuring out what else I might want?

"I don't know," I admit. "I haven't really thought about it."

"Maybe you should."

And somewhere in these conversations, I realize I'm performing for her a little bit. Choosing stories I think she'll find funny or interesting, paying attention to what makes her smile. Wanting to be someone worth her Thursday afternoons.

When did that happen? When did her opinion start to matter?

Back in Omaha between runs, Tommy notices the change.

"You seem different lately," he says one afternoon in early September, handing me paperwork for the next load. "More... I don't know. Present."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Usually when you're here you're already gone in your head, thinking about the next mile. But lately you're actually engaged. Making conversation. You even laughed at Jerry's terrible joke yesterday."

"Jerry's jokes are terrible."

"Exactly. You never used to care enough to notice." Tommy lights a cigarette, studies me through the smoke. "So what changed?"

"Nothing changed. I'm the same as always."

"Kid, I've known you two years. You're not the same. You're..." He searches for the word. "Lighter. Like something that was weighing on you isn't quite so heavy anymore."

I don't know what to say to that. Is he right? Do I feel lighter? Maybe. Maybe Junction City—maybe Nina—has given me something I didn't know I was missing. Permission to be present instead of always running toward the next thing.

The following week, Tommy calls me into his office with what he says is "an opportunity."

"Got a request from a company in Denver," he explains. "They need a dedicated driver for a new route—Denver to Oklahoma City and back. Pays better than what you're making now, and it's steady work. Year-long contract minimum."

"Denver to Oklahoma City."

"Three times a week. You'd be based out of Denver, get an apartment stipend, the whole deal."

My first thought is that Denver to Oklahoma City doesn't go through Junction City. Doesn't even come close. If I took this route, I wouldn't see Nina every two weeks. Wouldn't see her at all unless I deliberately drove hours out of my way.

"I'm good with what I've got," I hear myself say.

Tommy raises an eyebrow. "You sure? This is more money, more stability."

"I like the Omaha-St. Louis route. I'm used to it."

"Used to it or used to stopping in Junction City?"

The knowing look he gives me makes it clear he's figured something out. I don't confirm or deny it, just hold his gaze until he chuckles and shakes his head.

"All right, kid. Your call. But for what it's worth, whatever's in Junction City that's got you turning down better opportunities—might want to think about whether you're just visiting or if you're working up to staying."

The question haunts me for days. Visiting or staying? I'm a trucker. I don't stay anywhere. That's the whole point. That's what I told myself when I left home—that freedom meant motion, that safety meant not letting anyone matter enough to hurt me when I left.

But I'm also deliberately choosing routes that bring me back to the same place every two weeks. Looking forward to a town I used to pass through without thinking. Counting down days instead of miles. Turning down better opportunities because they don't include Junction City.

Because they don't include Nina.

That's not visiting. That's attachment.

And attachment is dangerous. Attachment means vulnerability, means caring about someone enough that leaving hurts, means being the kind of person someone depends on and disappointing them when it matters.

I've built my whole life around avoiding attachment. But somehow, without meaning to, without even noticing it happening, I've gotten attached to Nina Lawson.

The realization sits heavy in my chest as I drive toward Junction City two weeks after Tommy's offer. I should stop this. Should start taking different routes, spacing out my visits, letting this thing with Nina fade before it becomes something I can't walk away from.

But when I pull into the Crossroads Truck Stop and see her sitting in our booth with two cups of coffee already waiting—she knows my schedule well enough now to time it perfectly—all my carefully reasoned arguments evaporate.

"Hey," she says when I slide into the seat across from her. "How was the drive?"

"Good. Uneventful."

"Those are the best kind."

We smile at each other and something warm settles in my chest. This is becoming important. She's becoming important. And I don't know how to stop it or even if I want to.

"I missed this," Nina says quietly. "I know it's only been two weeks but Thursdays are the best part of my week now."

"Yeah," I admit, because lying seems pointless when she's looking at me like that. "Me too."

And there it is. The truth I've been avoiding for weeks. These biweekly meetings with Nina Lawson have become the thing I look forward to most. More than the freedom of the highway, more than the simplicity of driving, more than the safety of never staying anywhere long enough to matter.

Junction City matters. Nina matters.

And that terrifies me more than anything has in two years.

But not enough to make me leave.

Not yet, anyway.
